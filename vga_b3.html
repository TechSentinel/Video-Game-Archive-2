    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If  you're a Bejeweled beginner, here's how it works. Different-colored jewels fill  an eight-by-eight board. To wipe them away, you create groups of at least three  gems by swapping one gem with one located directly beside, above, or below it.  This causes those gems to disappear and the ones above to drop down, allowing  for new jewels to appear at the top. Matching four or more gems together  creates a special gem that will explode and remove surrounding jewels when it  is matched; the more jewels matched, the more powerful the explosion. Matching  like-colored gems in a T- or L-shaped pattern creates a star gem that will zap  away all gems of a particular color. The most traditional way of experiencing  Bejeweled is in Classic mode, which returns in this sequel. Here, you keep  making matches until you run out of moves. The mode is as addictive as ever,  encouraging you to plan out your moves so you can create falling cascades of  gems, build up a high score, and avoid that heart-sinking &quot;no more  moves&quot; message that brings your run of combos screeching to a halt.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">As  good as Classic mode is, Bejeweled 3 is at its best when it provides a sense of  urgency. If you need a time-ticking challenge, Lightning mode is your basic  test of skill. As the clock approaches zero, special time gems tumble onto the  board, and clearing them lets you add precious seconds to the clock. This is  more or less like the Blitz mode in previous games, but it's a good way to get  your finger tapping and your eyes roaming the board for the best combinations.  The best of the new modes take that kind of heart-pumping challenge and twist  it up in a number of ways. One of the best ways is in Ice Storm, in which  columns of ice rise from the bottom of the board and must be smashed by making  matches. Because vertical and horizontal matches have different effects on the  ice, you have to make split-second decisions when faced with multiple possible  matches. This gets incredibly fun and intense and is probably the best mode to  choose if you have a few minutes to spare and want a quick rush. Diamond Mine  provides a similar kind of stimulation. In this mode, you must explode jewels  at the bottom of the screen to dig into the terrain, where artifacts and gold  deposits await. The time limit keeps the thrill level high, and it's a lot of  fun to watch your well-planned explosions dig up chunks of earth.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="570" height="322" src="game-content-img/vga_b3_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/342/reviews/1600732-611468_20101209_001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Ice  is back with a brand new invention.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Other  modes provide different kinds of excitement. Butterflies mode is a great  addition in which gems with butterfly wings rise a row after every match you  make. The spider at the top of the screen is all too eager to eat these  beauties, so you need to clear them before they reach the top. Once many  butterflies are on the screen at once, you must plan your moves carefully, and  matching butterflies causes them to flit away in a satisfying flurry of wings.  Quest mode morphs the different modes into specific challenges in which, for  example, you must clear a certain number of butterflies or dig up a certain  amount of gold before you can continue to the next leg of your journey. This  mode gives the standard Bejeweled gameplay a nice sense of progression that keeps  you pushing forward to unlock the next round of puzzles. Then, there's Poker  mode, which eschews the importance of flame gems and combos; it instead asks  you to create poker hands by matching gems of specific colors. It's an  interesting variation, and the Vegas-style sound and visual effects that jazz  up your flushes are a nice reward for your well-considered moves. The  meaningless nature of combos in this mode, however, makes it less joyous than  the others.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Zen  mode is another one of the new offerings and is Bejeweled 3's attempt to  fulfill fans of the burgeoning ambient game genre exemplified by such releases  as&nbsp;Flow,&nbsp;Flower, and&nbsp;The UnderGarden. It wants to relax you, but  the bizarre result isn't relaxing as much as cheesy--though the cheesiness  provides its own kind of entertainment. This is an endless mode in which you  can turn on relaxation-tape noises, such as seagulls and waves, and perhaps you  will be able to calm your nerves in this manner. The other options in this mode  are less likely to relax you than make you giggle, however. You can turn on  mantra messages with themes like &quot;weight loss&quot; and &quot;positive  thinking,&quot; but these pronouncements (&quot;My body is perfect right  now&quot;) are more quaint and kooky than inspirational. You can also activate  other features, such as a breathing indicator, but they seem out of place. Good  ambient games are successful because every element is built around a singular  idea. Bejeweled 3 layers its eccentric concepts onto a game that wasn't created  to support them, and it's a combination that doesn't gel. Nevertheless, an  endless mode is always welcome, and even if the pleasure you get is more zany  than Zen, it's pleasure all the same.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="589" height="333" src="game-content-img/vga_b3_clip_image004_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/342/reviews/1600733-611468_20101209_002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You  give me butterflies inside.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It  speaks to Bejeweled's classic core gameplay that it still inspires the same  one-more-round compulsion of its predecessors. The bright jewels, the glassy  plink-plink noise of successful matches, and the deep bass of the announcer who  cries out &quot;excellent&quot; with the gravitas of a sorcerer splitting the  earth make it easy to stay under the game's spell. Yet this spell has been cast  before, and in spite of its new modes and clear appeal, Bejeweled 3 is about as  safe a route as developer PopCap Games could have taken. The  match-three-or-more gameplay hasn't evolved, so it's hard to shake the sense  that you've played this game before. At a price of $19.99, you might reasonably  have expected more from a Bejeweled sequel--at the very least, online  leaderboards or Steam achievements that allow you to show off your gem-matching  skills. Alas, Bejeweled 3 features neither, which makes them disappointing  omissions in a score-focused puzzle sequel from a major developer.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">But  it's the safe approach that will make legions of Bejeweled fans happy as they  swap jewels and race the clock to better their previous scores. Bejeweled 3 is  the kind of game that attracts almost anyone, whether you are a longtime video  game player or the grandparent of one. And the best of the new modes are so fun  that there are still reasons to splurge for this sequel and ignore the high  price point--even if you've explored the depths of every Bejeweled game and  clone in existence. Whether you have a few minutes to kill or want to lose  yourself for an hour or two, there's something here to satisfy, though you'll  surely be struck by a strong sense of deja vu.</p>
