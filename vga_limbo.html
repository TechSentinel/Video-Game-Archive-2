    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Limbo,  the game, is special in that while it does not wholly depict that mysterious  dimension as my mind did, it captures its essence. You are a boy who wakes up  in a lonely world made up only of black, white, and shades of gray. Video game  logic demands you walk from left to right, jumping over obstacles as they  appear, a simple task that needs little attention in the initial moments. This  is your chance to absorb your surroundings. The background provides an illusion  of depth, but its branches and bridges are out of focus, as if you are dreaming  them into existence. The pint-sized hero, his bright blinking eyes shining from  his blackened silhouette, trots ahead with the charming gangliness of a  six-year-old.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="546" height="308" src="game-content-img/vga_limbo_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2757163-2014120913323829.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You  can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Then  comes death. Limbo is a hostile place, home to giant spiders that would feast  upon you, and traps apparently scattered by the world's other denizens. You  step onto a claw trap, and it closes on your neck. Your head falls to the  ground and wobbles just for a moment before lying still. No tears are shed, no  music plays--the game provides no grand gesture to honor your demise. It simply  happens, and you revive at the most recent checkpoint to try the puzzle again.  Some of these deaths aren't outright fair; stepping on a pressure plate could  mean certain death, but so could jumping over it. Such inconsistencies aren't  common, but your first time in Limbo requires some trial-and-error  experimentation. Loading times are short, and checkpoints are frequent,  however, so death is rarely a frustration, though often a horror.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">What  does it all mean? People pondered that question when&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/limbo-review/1900-6415989/"><span style="color:windowtext; ">Limbo</span></a>&nbsp;was first released on the Xbox  360 in 2010, and the Xbox One version adds nothing new that would illuminate  the mystery of this world, so there's little reason to splurge on another  version if you've already played. Nevertheless, the ending offers important  clues to the greater plot, if not to the details of the game's events and  objects--the imposing neon hotel sign that you must cross, for instance, or the  murderous children, seemingly escaped from&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Flies</em>, that  aim their blowguns at you. Limbo means for its atmosphere to consume you in the  moment, and in that sense, it succeeds. You drag a dead child's corpse to solve  a puzzle, and perhaps wonder if anyone grieves this lost soul given the apathy  of the realm. You glimpse a figure and regard her with tenderness, but the  brief glimmer of hope is snuffed out in an instant.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="493" height="278" src="game-content-img/vga_limbo_clip_image004_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2757165-2014120910285040.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="271" src="game-content-img/vga_limbo_clip_image005_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2757166-2014120910285057.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">After  life, before death.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It  isn't until the final third of its two- to three-hour runtime that Limbo's  puzzles become challenging. The first half of the game is more concerned with building  dread and ambiguity. Even after being vanquished, a colossal spider's remaining  leg thrusts at you from its thorax, one final act of defiance that could leave  two corpses for the crows to pick. When you pull the leg from the spider, the  audible cracks and visible white splatters emphasize just how recently its life  force was crushed. Elsewhere, you push boxes and pull levers, rushing to finish  the puzzle before the rising water fills the room. Failure means watching the  dear boy go as limp as a ragdoll as liquid fills his lungs.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  second half leaves behind the horrors in favor of puzzles involving gravity and  complex machinery. As memorable as it is to navigate tilting rooms with only a  few hanging lamps to light the way, it is that spider that most embodies  Limbo's somber spirit. The later puzzles are complex and clever, but they don't  haunt the heart. The finale feels abrupt because it returns to the first hour's  imagery, having abandoned it for long enough to have altered your personal  connection with the game from an emotional one to an intellectual one. And yet  the end offers insight into a backstory left otherwise untouched--enough of it  to inspire another playthrough, this time ever so much wiser than you were  before.</p>
