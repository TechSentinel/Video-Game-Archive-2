    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Pagan Min is a  nasty piece of work. He is the vain and arrogant despot that welcomes you to  the fictional Himalayan nation of Kyrat with a depraved display of violence.  Min is a horrific man, and you are meant to despise him--or at least, it would  seem so until he ends his tirade by inviting you to &quot;tear shit up&quot;  while The Clash takes over the soundtrack, preparing you for a power fantasy  just seconds after the game has purposefully turned your stomach. Afterwards,  Min covers your head with a sack and escorts you to his opulent residence.  There, in sight of a bowl of monkey heads ready to be cracked open and engorged  upon, He again demonstrates his ruthlessness by plunging a fork into the back  of your local guide and forcing him to bail out the window for help.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Far Cry 4 is loaded  with such tonal shifts, so many that you might suspect the game is trying to  make a point with them. The writing takes rare turns into the self-aware; one  character, for instance, calls out the hypocrisy of an American intruding on  the affairs of a foreign state, pointing guns and splattering blood in the name  of &quot;doing the right thing.&quot; But if Far Cry 4 was meant to parody the  violent themes it depicts, it does a poor job of it. You are Ajay Ghale, an  American who has come to Kyrat to scatter your departed mother's ashes per her  wishes, though it isn't long before you have taken up the cause of The Golden  Path, the same separatist group your mother helped found. Where matters of the  rebellion are concerned, Far Cry 4 keeps things serious, often forcing you to  choose between the wishes of the current Golden Path co-leaders, and locking  yourself into one mission while foregoing its counterpart. These leaders--Amita  and Sabal--both have good intentions, seeking only the best for their  impoverished nation, though Sabal's insistence at one point that Amita is using  her gender as a manipulation tactic makes it clear that he, and the game  itself, don't always represent meaningful progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">It's  impossible to be invested in these characters, however, not after a  pseudo-serious speech is followed by a confrontation with two embarrassing  stoners who blow smoke in your face while embodying every possible drug-culture  caricature. The story's best asset, its villain, disappears for most of the  story, leaving more dialogue to a local radio personality who fantasizes about  becoming a serial killer who smears feces on his victims as a calling card. Far  Cry 4 does not improve upon&nbsp;Far  Cry 3's narrative issues, but amplifies them until the story collapses into a  pile of yee-haw hillbilly language, cliched tribalism, and weak political  posturing. For a game primarily interested in providing a joyous first-person  sandbox, Far Cry 4 is oddly adamant about choking you with its meager attempts  to titillate.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_farcry4_clip_image001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2732994-hdpvr2_20141111_225069.jpg"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Like  the Nepalese-esque environments it depicts, Far Cry 4 is all about highs and  lows, suffocating you with poor storytelling before setting you free into the  wilderness to create thrills of your own. And those thrills can be almost  overwhelming, providing the kind of headrush that was Far Cry 3's calling card.  It is you and a giant map dotted with activities, each one fun enough that you  want to rush towards the waypoint to see what's in store there</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Perhaps  it's an outpost that need liberating from Min's army. You can force freedom  upon it by sneaking around, stabbing baddies from behind and throwing knives  into their comrades' foreheads in one smooth motion. But Far Cry 4's additions  are tailored towards chaos, and it's difficult to escape their gravity.  Throwing a simple slab of meat invites a tiger or a bear (or even a violent  honey badger, a reference that would have been dated even a few years ago) to  the bloody party. The creature isn't a familiar--it may turn on you once it's  done feasting on Min's soldiers' meat--so there's only minor guilt in throwing  a molotov cocktail into the mix and watching the flaming feline strike fear into  your foes' hearts. Of course, you might be sprinting about all the while,  spraying AK-47 fire around, or lobbing grenades from your launcher, the most  effective sidearm available in the early game.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Or  perhaps you believe in truly going big. Elephants may seem like peaceful  titans, but once mounted, they are one of Far Cry 4's most destructive forces.  One story mission puts pachyderms to particularly good use, offering you  plentiful opportunities to overturn oncoming vehicles with a quick flip of the trunk.  You haven't truly lived until you have launched an opposing soldier into the  air and heard his screams. If you come to games to feel powerful, Far Cry 4  quenches that need. That isn't to say the game is easy; insta-fail stealth  missions and enemy artillery can bring the frustration, but you typically have  the tools to counter it. If sneaking around is making you swear, a bow and  arrow will do nicely. If you're being mobbed, you can spend a token that spawns  an AI companion to fight at your side.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Real-life  companions are even better. A buddy (or stranger) can join you on your  adventure, and the two of you become a kind of madcap duo, wreaking even more  havoc on Kyrat's struggling economy by ruining and pillaging everything in  sight. It's fun to get around in Far Cry 4's dinky gyrocopters, but the real  joy is grappling to it and swinging to and fro as your comrade rises into the  air. Should an enemy helicopter whir into view, it's tempting to take it out  with a rocket, but you could always have your friend swing you into range, and  blast the copter's pilot with a shotgun to the face. Should a pack of dholes  (wild dogs, that is) attack, it's nice to shoot and skin them with a pal at  your side. There's a pleasant sense of camaraderie to it, the two of you tromping  through a creek on elephants like a gray, wrinkly caravan.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_farcry4_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2732995-hdpvr2_20141111_1918121.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Far  Cry 4 isn't content to simply provide a map loaded with icons to chase: it  parades activities in front of you as if it's afraid you'll not notice just how  much stuff there is to do. You liberate an outpost and drive away, and you're  bombarded in ten seconds by notifications that it is already under attack.  Should you return and provide support, your next departure might be met with  the same instructions; should you drive off, Far Cry 4 informs you of your  failure to protect the outpost. I'm grateful for the game's imperfect but  helpful auto-drive feature, which allows you to hand over the wheel to the AI  if you want to focus on firing your pistol at pursuing ATVs. I'm not so  grateful for Far Cry 4's habit of moving the waypoint icon to nearby outposts  under attack on my behalf, thus causing my vehicle to drive where the game  wants, not where I want. Why is such a massive sandbox so eager to lure me away  from my own adventure? Why would a game whose best story is the one I make for  myself keep thrusting some other story in front of me, making me eat my  broccoli before I'm allowed to have dessert?</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">At  least the dessert is scrumptious, supported by Far Cry 4's excellent economy,  which dangles goodies in front of you and dares you to go earn enough rupees to  buy them. Soon you discover that your wallet needs upgrading before you can  hold more rupees, and that your backpack only holds so many saleable doodads  until you craft a larger one. And so off you go to hunt and skin the wildlife  so that you may turn their hides into a bigger ammo pouch. You obsessively  snatch herbs and flowers so you can make healing syringes and other helpful  implements, and climb radio towers so that you can lift the nearby fog of war  and reveal even more activities to perform. It's easy to be ensnared by this  web of&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; ">stuff</span></em>, wanting a thing that requires that you do  another thing, which in turn requires that you do even another thing. Of  course, that stuff follows a recipe Ubisoft has been stewing for years now,  which is filling but starting to taste too familiar. This is the Far  Cry/Assassin's Creed/Watch Dogs&nbsp;formula  on hyperdrive: no piece of real estate is safe from the&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; ">stuff</span></em>-web.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="596" height="336" src="game-content-img/vga_farcry4_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2732985-hdpvr2_20141111_123841.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Kyrat is gorgeous, that much is clear.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The  story at least provides plenty of diversity. Sometimes, you're pumped full of  drugs and float away to Shangri-la, where you admire the dreamy visuals and sic  tigers on demons; sometimes, you're maintaining oxygen levels while exploring  the perilous heights of the Himalayas. Far Cry 3's missions ultimately made the  greater impression: Far Cry 4's drug-destroying quest owes a clear debt to its  predecessor's similar (and better) analog, and 3's hallucinogenic trips were  more memorable than the sojourns to Shangri-la. Even so, Far Cry 4's best  missions make good use of the game's general scale, providing intricate spreads  of horizontal and vertical spaces, and giving you the freedom to approach them  as you like.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The  ties to earlier Ubisoft games are inescapable. You tear propaganda posters from  walls in the manner of Assassin&rsquo;s, and unveil new portions of the map in the  manner of, well, most recent Ubisoft games. The condensed freeform missions, on  the other hand, are more akin to&nbsp;Splinter  Cell: Blacklist, though that isn't the only feature reminiscent of Sam Fisher's  more recent games. Far Cry 4 features a light bit of competitive play that pits  two asymmetrical teams against each other. The objectives change depending on  which mode you choose, but the basics remain the same. One group plays as  hunters, armed with bows and arrows, and capable of going invisible and  mounting elephants; the other drives standard vehicles and selects from a full  array of weapons, approaching battle with sheer force.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The  best part of competitive play is that it offers many of the campaign's  freedoms. You can ride the winds in your wingsuit towards a capture point,  create ad-hoc walls of flame with molotovs, and snipe a competitor while he  struggles to fend off an attacking bird of prey. Teams also seek to control  towers that reveal hunters on the minimap (or remove them), which adds another  speck of strategy to the proceedings. These five-on-five matches are open-ended  delights, not so much because the battles are loaded with tension, but because  they reward adaptability, and in doing so, echo the campaign.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">It's  a problematic campaign, certainly, forcing you to restart an entire mission  from scratch if you arrive at your destination and realize you'd like a  different loadout, and making you reach for the radio dial so you don't have to  listen to the worst radio personality this side of the Great Wall of China.  It's when you circumvent Far Cry 4's major thematic flaws, inconsistent  missions, and incessant nagging that you find the game you came looking for,  breathing easy and enjoying the mountains that rise in the distance and the  valleys that stretch beneath you. Like the terrain if depicts, Far Cry 4  travels both high and low, representing the good, the bad, and ugly of video  games all at once. It's awesome and messy and dumb and fun and annoying and  gross and beautiful. Take any given adjective in your vocabulary, and chances  are, it will in some way describe Far Cry 4.</span></p>
