    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This focus is  obvious from the first hour of the game, in which character creation and story  exposition are beautifully woven together. It's an introduction best  experienced on your own rather than described in detail here, but it does set  up Fallout 3's framework: It's the year 2277, and you and your father are  residents of Vault 101, one of many such constructs that shelter the earth's  population from the dangers of post nuclear destruction. When dad escapes the  vault without so much as a goodbye, you go off in search of him, only to find  yourself snagged in a political and scientific tug of war that lets you change  the course of the future. As you make your way through the decaying remnants of  the District and its surrounding areas (you'll visit Arlington, Chevy Chase,  and other suburban locales), you encounter passive-aggressive ghouls, a  bumbling scientist, and an old Fallout friend named Harold who has, well, a lot  on his mind. Another highlight is a diminutive collective of&nbsp;<em>Lord of  the Flies</em>-esque refugees who reluctantly welcome you into their society,  assuming that you play your cards right.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="background:#F2F2F3; "><img width="602" height="254" src="game-content-img/vga_fallout3_clip_image002_0001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2008/300/reviews/913933-939933_20081027_001.jpg"></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-align:center;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-left:108.0pt;text-align:center;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal;">Welcome to the wasteland.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The city is also  one of Fallout 3's stars. It's a somber world out there, in which a crumbling  Washington Monument stands watch over murky green puddles and lurching beasts  called mirelurks. You'll discover new quests and characters while exploring, of  course, but traversing the city is rewarding on its own, whether you decide to  explore the back rooms of a cola factory or approach the heavily guarded steps  of the Capitol building. In fact, though occasional silly asides and amusing  dialogue provide some humorous respite, it's more serious than previous Fallout  games. It even occasionally feels a bit stiff and sterile, thus diminishing the  sense of emotional connection that would give some late-game decisions more  poignancy. Additionally, the franchise's black humor is present but not nearly  as prevalent, though Fallout 3 is still keenly aware of its roots. The haughty  pseudogovernment called the Enclave and the freedom fighters known as the  Brotherhood of Steel are still powerful forces, and the main story centers  around concepts and objectives that Fallout purists will be familiar with.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Although some of  that trademark Bethesda brittleness hangs in the air, the mature dialogue (it's  a bit unnerving but wholly authentic the first time you hear 8-year-olds  muttering expletives) and pockets of backstory make for a compelling trek.  There are more tad bits than you could possibly discover on a single  play-through. For example, a skill perk (more on these later) will enable you  to extract information from a lady of the evening, information that in turn  sheds new light on a few characters--and lets you complete a story quest in an  unexpected way. A mission to find a self-realized android may initiate a  fascinating look at a futuristic Underground Railroad, but a little side  gossiping might let you lie your way to quest completion. There aren't as many  quests as you may expect, but their complexity can be astonishing. Just be sure  to explore them fully before pushing the story forward: Once it ends, the game  is over, which means that you'll need to revert to an earlier saved game if you  intend to explore once you finish the main quest.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Thus choices are  ruled only by your own sense of propriety and the impending results. For every  &quot;bad&quot; decision you make (break into someone's room, sacrifice a  soldier to save your own hide), your karma goes down; if you do something  &quot;good&quot; (find a home for an orphan, give water to a beggar), your  karma goes up. These situations trigger more consequences: Dialogue choices  open up, others close off, and your reputation will delight some while  antagonizing others. For example, a mutant with a heart of gold will join you  as a party member, but only if your karma is high enough, whereas a brigand  requires you to be on the heartless side. Even in the last moments of the game,  you are making important choices that will be recounted to you during the ending  scene, similar to the endings in the previous Fallout games. There are loads of  different ending sequences depending on how you completed various quests, and  the way they are patched together into a cohesive epilogue is pretty clever.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Fallout 3 remains  true to the series&rsquo; character development system, using a similar system of  attributes, skills, and perks, including the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system from  previous games for your attributes, such as strength, perception, and  endurance. From there, you can specialize in a number of skills, from heavy  weapons and lock-picking to item repairing and terminal hacking. You will  further invest in these skills each time you level, and you'll also choose an  additional perk. Perks offer a number of varied enhancements that can be both  incredibly helpful and a bit creepy. You could go for the ladykiller perk,  which opens up dialogue options with some women and makes others easier to  slay. Or the cannibal perk, which lets you feed off of fallen enemies to regain  health at the risk of grossing out anyone who glimpses this particularly nasty  habit. Not all of them are so dramatic, but they're important aspects of  character development that can create fascinating new options.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="background:#F2F2F3; "><img width="611" height="329" src="game-content-img/vga_fallout3_clip_image004_0001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2008/300/reviews/913934-939933_20081027_002.jpg"></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:center;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:center;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal;">The VATS system makes for some  awesome-looking battles.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Although  you can play from an odd-looking third-person perspective (your avatar looks  like he or she is skating over the terrain), Fallout 3 is best played from a  first-person view. Where combat is concerned, you will play much of the game as  if it is a first-person shooter, though awkwardly slow movement and camera  speeds mean that you'll never confuse it for a true FPS. Armed with any number  of ranged and melee weapons, you can bash and shoot attacking dogs and random  raiders in a traditional manner. Yet even with its slight clunkiness, combat is  satisfying. Shotguns (including the awesome sawed-off variant) have a lot of  oomph, plasma rifles leave behind a nice pile of goo, and hammering a mutant's  head with the giant and cumbersome supersledge feels momentously brutal. Just  be prepared to maintain these implements of death: Weapons and armor will  gradually lose effectiveness and need repairing. You can take them to a  specialist for fixing, but you can also repair them yourself, as long as you  have another of the same item. It's heartbreaking to break a favored weapon  while fending off supermutants, but it reinforces the notion that everything  you do in Fallout 3, even shooting your laser pistol, has consequences.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">These  aspects keep Fallout 3 from being a run-and-gun affair, and you shouldn't  expect to play it as one. This is because the most satisfying and gory moments  of battle are products of the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or VATS.  This system is a throwback to the action-point system of previous Fallout  games, in that it lets you pause the action, spend action points by targeting a  specific limb on your enemy, and watch the bloody results unfold in slow  motion. You aren't guaranteed a hit, though you can see how likely you are to  strike any given limb and how much damage your attack might do. But landing a  hit in VATS is immensely gratifying: The camera swoops in for a dramatic view,  your bullet will zoom toward its target, and your foe's head might burst in a  shocking explosion of blood and brains. Or perhaps you will blow his limb  completely off, sending an arm flying into the distance--or launch his entire  body into oblivion.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">This  anatomically based damage is implemented well. Shooting an Enclave soldier's  arm may cause him to drop his weapon, shooting his leg will cause him to limp,  and a headshot will disorient him. But you aren't immune to these effects,  either. If your head takes enough damage, you'll need to deal with disorienting  aftereffects; crippled arms mean reduced aiming ability. Fortunately, you can  apply healing stimpacks locally to heal the injury; likewise, a little sleep  will help ease your troubles. You can also temporarily adjust your stats using  any number of aids and healing items. Yet these, too, come with consequences. A  little scotch or wine sounds delicious and offers temporary stat boosts, but  you can become addicted if you drink them enough, which results in its own  disorienting visual effects. And, of course, you will need to deal with the  occasional effects of radiation, which is a problem when you drink from dirty  water sources or eat irradiated food. Radiation poisoning can be cured, but  you'll still need to weigh the healing benefits of certain items versus the  resultant increase in radiation levels.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; background:#F2F2F3; "><img width="599" height="295" src="game-content-img/vga_fallout3_clip_image006_0001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2008/300/reviews/913935-939933_20081027_003.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Quests are often more than meets the eye</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">This  all makes for a remarkably complex game that's further deepened by other  elements that add some gameplay variety and help the world feel more lived-in.  Lock-picking initiates a decent, if odd, minigame that simulates applying  torque to the lock with a screwdriver while twisting a bobby pin. The hacking  minigame is an interesting word puzzle that requires a little bit of  brainpower. Or if you fancy yourself more of a blacksmith than a wordsmith, you  can earn and purchase schematics to help you create weapons using the various  components scattered around the land. More of an interior decorator? No matter:  Should you acquire the deed to an apartment, you can decorate it and even  outfit it with a few helpful appliances. The jokester robot comes free.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Although  you'll be spending much of your time wandering alone out in the wastes, or  perhaps with a companion or two, there are some memorable cinematic sequences.  You will join soldiers as they take on a giant boss mutant, spearhead an  assault on a famous DC landmark, and escape from a doomed citadel while robots  and soldiers fill the air with laser fire. It's a good mix, paying off the  atmospheric tension with an occasional explosive release. Your enemies put up a  good fight--often too good, considering that enemies that were a challenge  early on can still be tough cookies 5 or 10 levels later. This scaling  difficulty makes your sense of progression feel a bit more limited than in  other role-playing games, but it feels somewhat appropriate, considering the  game's open-ended nature and inhospitable world. After all, if skulking mutants  weren't a constant threat, you wouldn't be afraid to peek into the dark corners  of the Fallout world. It should be noted that unlike previous games in the  series, you can&rsquo;t take a completely peaceful approach to solving your quest. In  order to complete the game, you will have to get into combat and kill off some  enemies, but since the combat system is generally pretty satisfying, this  shouldn&rsquo;t be a serious problem for most players.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Fallout  3 takes place in a bombed-out, futuristic version of Washington DC, and in the  game, the area is bleak but oddly serene. Crumbling overpasses loom overhead  and optimistic 1950's-style billboards advertise their products with sunny  catchphrases. It looks impressive, and you move around the wide-open wasteland  with nary a loading time, though you will encounter loads when entering and  exiting buildings or quick-jumping to areas you've already visited. Numerous set-piece  landmarks are particularly ominous, such as a giant aircraft carrier that  serves as a self-contained city, or the decrepit interiors of the National Air  and Space Museum. But the small touches are just as terrific, such as  explosions that produce mushroom-like clouds of flame and smoke, evoking the  nuclear tragedy at the heart of Fallout 3's concept. Character models are more  lifelike than in the developer's prior efforts but still move somewhat stiffly,  lacking the expressiveness of the models in games such as Mass Effect.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">It's  a shame, in light of these impressive design elements, that the PlayStation 3  version is shockingly inferior to the others from a technical perspective.  Although the Xbox 360 and PC versions display the occasional visual oddity and  bland texture, these nitpicks are easy to overlook. Sadly, the jagged edges,  washed-out lighting, and slightly diminished draw distance of the PS3 release  aren't so easy to dismiss. We also experienced a number of visual bugs on the  PS3. Character faces disappeared several times, leaving only eyeballs and hair;  limbs on robots went missing; some character models had an odd outline around  them as if they were cel-shaded; and the day-to-night transition may cause odd  streaks on the screen as you move the camera around. This version doesn't even  offer trophies, whereas the Xbox 360 and PC versions offer Xbox Live/Windows  Live achievements.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="606" height="287" src="game-content-img/vga_fallout3_clip_image008_0001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2008/300/reviews/913936-939933_20081027_004.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:normal;">While there is  plenty of sombre exploration, you'll still find lots of action.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Aside from a few PS3-specific sound quirks, the  audio in every version is marvelous. Most of the voice acting is great, some  sleepy-sounding performances notwithstanding. Any game's atmosphere can live or  die by its ambient audio, and Fallout 3 rises to the challenge. The whistling  of the wind and the far-off sound of a gunshot are likely to give you a chill,  and the slow-motion groans and crunch of a baseball bat meeting a ghoul's face  sound wonderfully painful. If you get lonely and want some company, you can  listen to a couple of radio stations, though the frequent repetition of the  songs and announcements grates after a while. The soundtrack is fine, though  it's a bit overwrought considering the desolate setting. Luckily, its default  volume is very low, so it doesn't get in the way.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">No matter what platform you own, you should play  Fallout 3, which overcomes its issues by offering a deep and involving journey  through a world that's hard to forget. It has more in common with Bethesda's  Elder Scrolls series than with previous Fallout games, but that is by no means  a bad thing. In fact, Fallout 3 is leaner and meaner than Bethesda's previous  efforts, less expansive but more intense, while still offering immense replay  value and quite a few thrills along the way. Whether you're a newcomer to the  universe or a Fallout devotee, untold hours of mutated secrets are lurking in  the darkest corners of Washington. </p>
