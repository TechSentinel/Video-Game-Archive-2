    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">world  of Black Flag is nothing short of remarkable. This is the most expansive  setting in the history of the franchise, a virtual rendition of the West Indies  that encompasses all manner of burgeoning colonies, Mayan ruins, and deadly  jungles. Cities like Havana and Nassau reflect the series' trademark attention  to detail, from the stonework cathedrals of the former to the ramshackle  taverns of the latter. Then there are the remote islands inhabited by nothing  more than crabs and sea turtles, underwater shipwrecks waiting to be explored,  and vast stretches of sparkling Caribbean waters that are every bit as deadly  as they are gorgeous.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Indeed,  what makes Black Flag so special is the way it captures the thrill of sailing  the open sea. It's more than the spectacle of a humpback whale leaping into the  air and spraying the deck of your ship, or the sound of your crew breaking out  into a sea shanty just as the sun is beginning to set across the horizon. It's  the feeling that there's always something out there to be discovered, rewards  waiting to be captured no matter who's standing in your way.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="582" height="328" src="game-content-img/vga_ac4bf_clip_image002.png" alt="http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/642/6422750/2355648-pix_001_537a.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Simply sailing into the sunset is a delight in Assassin's Creed IV:  Black Flag.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">What  began as a series of isolated side missions in&nbsp;&nbsp;has  exploded into a full-fledged means of exploration, discovery, and combat. Early  into Black Flag, Kenway takes the helm of the Jackdaw, a pirate ship that has  clearly seen better days. From there, it's your charge to build the Jackdaw  into a vessel capable of taking on the most powerful warships in the Caribbean.  After all, that Spanish gold isn't going to plunder itself.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Taking  on naval superpowers seems like a tall order early on, but pushing yourself to  improve your once-rickety ship is a process that Black Flag makes incredibly  rewarding. This is a game that gives you an absurd number of ways to acquire  the coin and resources needed to hold your own at sea. You might run off in  search of buried treasure using nothing more than a crudely drawn map, or  silently infiltrate a military storehouse to collect the wood and metal needed  to bolster the Jackdaw's hull. That bit of flotsam floating in the distance might  be a crate of rum you can sell to make up the difference on your new mortar  upgrades, or it might be a stranded sailor you can rescue to expand the size of  your crew. Black Flag doesn't just present a beautiful world; it gives you a  mountain of reasons to run off and go exploring.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="499" height="279" src="game-content-img/vga_ac4bf_clip_image003.png" alt="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/642/6422750/2355653-pix_001_539c.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Black Flag builds on ACIII's naval side missions to create an experience  every bit as important as running around on dry land.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Upgrading  your ship is critical because Black Flag places a huge emphasis on naval  combat. Both the storyline and side missions are full of tense sea battles,  where strategic positioning and explosive cannon fire come together in  exhilarating contests of naval supremacy. It's a system that allows for a  variety of tactics while never getting bogged down in overly complex controls,  whether you're picking off enemies from afar with a well-placed mortar strike  or dumping explosive barrels into the path of an unsuspecting foe. Whatever  approach you take, managing sea battles is an absolute blast.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's  not just wanton mayhem, either. Black Flag encourages you to take pause and  survey the landscape before charging into a fight. With the help of your  spyglass, you can scout another ship's cargo to decide whether the resources onboard  match your current needs, as well as scout out how much money you'll be able to  loot. This same tool also reveals an enemy's overall combat level, letting you  know if you should warm up against a few more level-8 schooners before taking  on that level-20 frigate. All this reconnaissance makes naval combat that much  more satisfying; success comes not only from how accurately you lob your  cannons, but from how adeptly you measure the risk versus the reward.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These  naval battles often lead directly into more traditional Assassin's Creed  swordfighting, and it's in those seamless transitions that Black Flag fuses its  two halves into one cohesive whole. Destroying a ship outright rewards you with  only half its cargo, so you need to board these vessels and wear down their  reluctant crews to reap the full reward. That means swinging acrobatically from  one ship to another, exchanging sword strikes with enemy sailors, and watching  your crew erupt in cheers once those enemies have surrendered. A similar  transition occurs during the game's numerous fort takeover missions, where you  bombard the defenses of a seaside fortress by ship before charging into the  ensuing chaos to assassinate its officers amid a storm of fire and smoke.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>Black Flag doesn't just  present a beautiful world; it gives you a mountain of reasons to run off and go  exploring.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">That  these acts of naval piracy continue to be so exciting so deep into the game's  lengthy story campaign is a testament to just how excellent Black Flag's  progression loop is. Raid an enemy gunboat, and you can scrap it for parts or  send it on trade route missions to earn more money on the side. Overtake a  fort, and you'll unlock dozens of new activities on the map, whether they're  the location of great white sharks whose skin you can turn into improved armor  or an underwater shipwreck you can explore once you've saved up enough for that  diving bell. No matter where you go or what you do, it's virtually impossible  to feel like you're not advancing in some way.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">And  it's a quick game to advance, too. Assassin's Creed III's crawling preamble and  frequent pacing issues are nowhere to be found here, as Black Flag wastes no  time throwing you into the life of a pirate. The story revolves around the  aforementioned Edward Kenway, a charming troublemaker from Bristol by way of  Swansea. If his name sounds familiar, it should: Edward is the grandfather of  ACIII protagonist Connor Kenway. The elder Kenway's backstory is rooted in a  fairly standard trope--a peasant off in search of wealth to build a better life  back home--but it's his unique place in the series' overarching fiction, and  the universal themes the story explores, that makes the narrative shine.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="502" height="281" src="game-content-img/vga_ac4bf_clip_image004.png" alt="http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/642/6422750/2355669-pix_001_539b.mov.still002.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Storms have a way of catching you off guard in Black Flag.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">At the  game's outset, Kenway is neither assassin nor templar. He's a man whose only  allegiance lies with his ship's crew, playing both factions against one another  for his own gain. But as the years wear on, the luster of youthful indiscretion  fades away as Kenway wrestles with a desire to find some greater purpose and a  longing to do right by his estranged wife back home. It's a story that explores  the human side of pirates, painting larger-than-life figures in a light that  even manages to turn Blackbeard into a sympathetic character.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  narrative grows a bit unwieldy toward the end, but finds its footing just  before a credit sequence that is far more touching than any story about pirates  has a right to be. An eclectic cast of side characters briefly dance with but  never fully tackle more powerful themes like race and gender in the age of  colonialism, but such narrative flirtations are one of the few shortcomings in  an otherwise terrific story. Even the modern-day chapters--brief and innocuous  as they may be--manage to add a refreshing and occasionally humorous take to  the Abstergo story arc.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Despite  the presence of pirates and scoundrels, the world of Black Flag is a  consistently gorgeous one. The Assassin's Creed series has always had a knack  for establishing an engrossing sense of place in its dense urban landscapes,  and Ubisoft hasn't missed a step in applying that same level of craftsmanship  toward the islands and jungles of the Caribbean. Black Flag looks especially  impressive on the PlayStation 4, where improved lighting and a greater  resolution bathe the world in a terrific level of visual fidelity and artistic  flourishes. You're better able to notice the little things, like the way  foliage gives way to Kenway while he sneaks through the bushes, or the  realistic flutter of fabric on your sails when a strong wind sweeps across the  sea. The current-generation versions of Black Flag still look terrific, but all  those little details in the PlayStation 4 version draw you into the world that  much more.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="573" height="323" src="game-content-img/vga_ac4bf_clip_image006.png" alt="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/642/6422750/2355670-pix_001_531a.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Cities like Havana echo the classic environments of previous games.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Kenway's  adventures on dry land don't amount to the same wholesale reinvention of the  series that his time aboard the Jackdaw does, but these portions of the game  have hardly been ignored. Ubisoft has borrowed a number of concepts from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/far-cry-3/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Far Cry 3</span></a>, and they  improve the on-foot experience immensely. Crafting animal hides into better  equipment is a far greater incentive to hunt wild animals than it was in ACIII,  while the ability to sabotage alarm bells in an enemy base adds more  flexibility to the stealth experience. But once a fight breaks out into a  full-on melee, Black Flag begins to feel much more like its predecessors:  swordfighting is as fluid and lively as ever, but lacks any substantial  refinements over previous games.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Where  that sense of deja vu hits Black Flag the hardest is in its overuse of  eavesdropping missions. Throughout the main story, the game asks you time and  again to tail your targets (but not too closely!) and eavesdrop on their  conversations (but not too obviously!) before finally letting you decide what  to do with them. These types of missions--a staple of the very first game in  the series--had already begun to show their age in recent Assassin's Creed  installments, and time hasn't done them any favors since then.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="498" height="279" src="game-content-img/vga_ac4bf_clip_image007.png" alt="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/642/6422750/2355673-pix_001_543.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Not all treasures are above water in Black Flag.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">While  less glaring, a similar lack of advancement can be found in Black Flag's  multiplayer. The cat-and-mouse nature of Wanted and the co-op chaos of Wolfpack  are still tremendous fun, but outside of a new story-driven tutorial mode,  there aren't any substantial additions. Even though Assassin's Creed  multiplayer has always occupied something of an &quot;icing on the cake&quot;  role, it's a shame this part of the game hasn't enjoyed the same creative  renewal that its single-player portion has.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">But  these moments of stagnation are isolated events in what is, ultimately, a  massive and highly ambitious game. Black Flag presents a world full of  adventure and opportunity, where treasures scavenged in a remote jungle can be  used to turn the tide in a massive naval battle against mighty Spanish  warships. It's a game where you can sail the seas for hours at a time, either  hunting great white sharks or simply listening to your crew sing one infectious  sea shanty after the next. There's an incredible scope to what you can do in Black  Flag, with a level of harmony between its component parts that encourages you  to try it all, and a story that keeps you invested throughout the whole thing.  If there was ever any question that Assassin's Creed needed something ambitious  to get the series back on track, Black Flag is that game and then some.</p>
