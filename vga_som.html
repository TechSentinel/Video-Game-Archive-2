    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Shadow  of Mordor's hero--or heroes, as it were--shares little thematic DNA with  Desmond Miles and his kin, however. You are a ranger called Talion--but you are  also a bitter wraith who shares Talion's body, the two cursed by unknown  forces, each seeking the answers that would allow for peace. For all purposes,  Talion should be dead, but his spiritual homecoming has been delayed by this  unholy union. Their journey of discovery takes them through Mordor and a nearby  region, where the cracked earth and the sight of suffering slaves serve as  warning signs; Death here is more common here than the healing herbs that  sometimes rise from the decayed soil.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">I'll  allow the more erudite Middle-earth experts to debate the authenticity of this  wraith-ranger hybrid. Talion certainly seems like a good fit for Tolkien's  universe, with his stringy shoulder-length hair, his stoic manner, and his  three-syllable moniker, which recalls names like Faramir and Aragorn. The wraith's  identity has been previously revealed, but I'd prefer not to disclose it here:  the murky flashbacks that depict his past deeds are all the more impactful when  you've denied yourself the spoiler. In any case, the Talion/wraith dichotomy  leads to Shadow of Mordor's slickest moments. The ghostly wraith slides out of  Talion's body from time to time to talk with him and then dissipates in a  vaporous sigh. When the wraith's anger becomes all-consuming, Talion's face  melts away to reveal the apparition underneath. Vague whispers and murmurs  bring an eerie chill to an otherwise parched setting; it's as if there is  danger of being frozen even in this grim hellscape.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="522" height="294" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2667639-0001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">There  is evil there that does not sleep.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These  touches give Shadow of Mordor a gossamer coating it greatly needed. The game's  occasionally iffy frame rate doesn't make a strong argument for the power of  the new console generation, but the burnt orange-brown cliffs and clouded skies  are nonetheless given their proper due. To exist here is to suffer a heavy  heart. Your ears are invaded by the growls and grunts of the grotesque Uruk-hai  that roam the land, and your eyes are overwhelmed by the crumbling ruins of  once-proud buildings. The same-ish landscapes wear thin in time, though a mid-game  change of scenery allows you to breathe in air not yet fully spoiled by the  evil Sauron's rancid presence. They say that the devil is in the details, but  in Mordor, the devil is plain to see. It is in the details that you find the  glimmers of light, even though you know that no happy ending is nigh. There is  hope in the hearty laugh of a dwarf that becomes your hunting partner, and in  the gentle words of a daughter protective of her sorcerous mother.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Had  I been more invested in the game's outcome, I might have appreciated those  glimmers even more. Shadow of Mordor hits the ground running, referring to the  past and future both while crafting its own story within the crevasses left  unexplored in book and movie form. Gollum is as disquieting a presence as ever,  and actor Liam O'Brien's excellent vocal performance is so on point, you would  assume Andy Serkis, who portrayed Gollum on film, had reprised the role here.  But for every recognizable character there is a less-established one, and both  variations weave in and out of the story with little explanation, kickstarting  the plot when necessary and then departing before you can truly come to know  them. The game's main villains appear before they're even properly introduced;  a Tolkien fanatic may be intrigued by their identities, but Shadow of Mordor  does too little to make them anything more than mean guys in fancy armor. The  incomplete storytelling, combined with a series of tepid final encounters,  unfortunately softens the sting of the conclusion's slashing and gnashing.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>Your  ears are invaded by the growls and grunts of the grotesque Uruk-hai that roam  the land, and your eyes are overwhelmed by the crumbling ruins of once-proud  buildings.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2667643-0002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Of  course, this is Tolkien, whose novels have always been about the unexpected  journey, not the expected destination. Shadow of Mordor is a raucous adventure.  You hold a single button to rush up towers and leap improbable distances, and  fluid animations make the locomotion feel (usually) breezy and fun. An Uruk  archer may be waiting atop that tower, but no matter: another button allows you  to stab him from below, though you could always sneak up from behind and sink  your hidden blade--er, your totally unhidden dagger--into his stinking flesh,  if you'd rather. Yes, it's easy to make the Assassin's Creed connections,  particularly when you encounter the frustrations Shadow of Mordor shares with  that other series: a lack of precise movement that makes certain simple actions  more trouble than they're worth, clumsy camera angles, and animation quirks  that turn close-quarters battles into awkward, jittery dances.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Luckily,  Shadow of Mordor greatly refines and improves other aspects of that established  formula. Combat, for instance, has a similar kind of flow, but it's more  challenging than you might be used to. Hordes of Uruk-hai surround you, and  your experience with other games might fool you into thinking you can manage  the mob. That little voice telling you can handle the challenge could be lying,  though. There are times when you must simply run. You might be able to hide in  a bush a few hundred feet away, or you might rush to a higher vantage point  until the crowd calms down. But to face the Uruk swarm, even when you time your  counter-attacks properly, is often to face your own demise and subsequent  resurrection.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="585" height="329" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image005.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2667644-0003.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Shadow  of Mordor loves to inundate you with reminders of basic mechanics it taught you  20 hours before. Enough, already!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  addition of a real challenge to this recipe has a lot of rewarding  repercussions. Stealth becomes a vital tool, for instance, even when the  mission at hand doesn't demand it. Orcs can be oddly oblivious when you  brutalize the fiends walking directly behind them, but iffy AI aside, sneaking  around is both helpful and exciting. Thinning the herd is a wise move, and  doing so often means gliding up to your target from behind in a crouched stance  that recalls Batman: Arkham Asylum, Shadow of Mordor's other great inspiration.  Try murdering Uruk-hai from a perch above, or fire the wraith's spectral arrows  into their heads. You'll be glad you did so when you command the attention of  an Uruk captain or the region's warchief.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">A  captain's arrival is a big deal, and Shadow of Mordor ensures you know it. Your  sword meets the leader's, the camera zooms in, and the Uruk taunts you with  howls and hisses that expose his situational awareness. Upon a first meeting,  the Uruk may promise you a grisly dismemberment; should you die and face the  same captain again, he will wonder how you cheated death, or ask if you are that  other ranger's twin brother. He might remark on the sneaky way you approached  him, or declare that he's now on to your combat tricks. The game's database of  potential responses must be enormous: I rarely heard the same lines twice, and  when I did, I was still amused by the Uruks' grand posturing. Such melodrama!  Each captain is so incredibly certain of his own victory that he must bare his  fangs and puff his chest up with pride.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="566" height="319" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image007.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2667648-0004.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's  like a leap of faith, except you can do it anywhere; no haystack required!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  only problem with making a mountain out of every orcish molehill is one of  pacing: after a while, I became annoyed by the incessant theatrical  introductions, which would sometimes occur just when nearing my target. It  doesn't matter if you're in the midst of battle or just rushing through the  area: the Uruk demands your respect, even if it means disrupting the flow and  forcing the camera away from its original direction once the hullabaloo is  complete. But what to do? Each captain craves his 15 minutes of fame.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Captains  aren't impossible to defeat, of course, but you'll be better equipped to defeat  them once you add a few additional skills to your repertoire, which you do by  performing missions and assassinating enemies. The move I came to most appreciate  allowed me to stun an enemy by leaping over his head, then unleash a barrage of  strikes that culminated in a cranial explosion. Repeating this move is the  closest I came to exploiting the combat system, unless you count my reliance on  converting Uruks to my cause, an option that doesn't unlock until the game  reaches its second act. In fact, Shadow of Mordor's best asset, the  hierarchical machinations it terms the nemesis system, doesn't truly shine  until the latter half.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>Talion  certainly seems like a good fit for Tolkien's universe, with his stringy  shoulder-length hair, his stoic manner, and his three-syllable moniker.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2667649-0005.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You  see, a dead Uruk doesn't tell tales, but there's always a mouthy filthmonger  ready to replace him. You can view the Uruk-hai's reporting order at a glance,  though you don't necessarily know every captain's identity or combat  weaknesses: you'll have to gain some intel for that. You most commonly gain  intel by dominating your foe rather than outright killing him. Shadow of Mordor's  executions are gory indeed, but domination is an even more fearsome process:  Talion's flesh fades away and the wraith is revealed in all his ferocity. You  roar out a battlecry--even simple shouts like &quot;You are mine!&quot; are  pregnant with barely-contained rage--and then violate the Uruk's mind. You then  examine the organizational Uruk flowchart, expose a captain's identity and/or  combat weaknesses, and then squash your victim's head like an overripe  cantaloupe. (Or, later, allow him to go free to spread word of your reign of  terror.)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This  is useful information to have. Again, overthrowing a captain or warchief is not  always a walk in the park, so knowing that your enemy is invulnerable to your  phantom arrows, or will succumb to a stealth kill, makes all the difference.  You can even instill fear in captains by shooting explosive barrels and  catching them on fire, or by riding a caragor into battle. Oh--did I not  mention you can mount a four-legged feline beast and command it to feast on  Uruk entrails? You can even clamber up walls while riding a caragor. Try that,  Altair!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>A  dead Uruk doesn't tell tales, but there's always a mouthy filthmonger ready to  replace him.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="603" height="339" src="game-content-img/vga_som_clip_image010.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2667654-2014092214364208.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Shadow  of Mordor's second half introduces even more ways to mess with Uruks' minds.  Ultimately, you are able to command individual captains and assist them in  battle as they fight their way up the pecking order. The story gives this  system a purpose so that your political shenanigans don't come across as  neverending busywork, though even without narrative context, the nemesis system  is remarkably absorbing. It is the orcish congress, and I am a muscled version  of Kevin Spacey's character in&nbsp;<em>House of Cards</em>. I am the  puppetmaster, and the Uruk-hai are my puppets.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">All  of these tasks are dotted across the game's two expansive maps, which invite  you to chase one waypoint after another, murdering captains, infiltrating Uruk  feasts, and collecting artifacts that unveil truths about the wraith's past  misdeeds. This structure (of course) recalls Assassin's Creed, but it is now  imperative that the Assassin's Creed series learn from Shadow of Mordor. Easy  comparisons aside, this is a great game in its own right, narratively  disjointed but mechanically sound, made up of excellent parts pieced together  in excellent ways. I already knew what future lay in store for Middle-earth as  I played Shadow of Mordor; I'm hoping that my own future might one day bring  another Lord of the Rings adventure as stirring as this one</p>
