    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  first few minutes of Call of Duty: Ghosts don't paint a terribly accurate  portrait of what lies ahead. You barely have time to take stock of the idyllic  Southern California setting before fire begins raining down from the heavens,  destroying every car and home in sight as a shouty man commands you to follow  him to safety. But whereas Infinity Ward's recent work on the&nbsp;<span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Modern Warfare</span>&nbsp;series was weighed  down by bewildering plot twists and an affinity for restricting its most  exciting moments to noninteractive set dressing, Ghosts tells a lean,  straightforward story that throws you into plenty of spectacular situations,  but with more breathing room to appreciate the action. Along with the  outstanding new Extinction co-op mode and an abundance of clever refinements to  competitive multiplayer, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a refreshing and thoroughly  satisfying entry in the blockbuster shooter franchise.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Much  of Ghosts' success stems from its own sense of humility. Infinity Ward has done  a great job reining in the excesses of previous Call of Duty campaigns,  replacing the crumbling Eiffel Tower and runaway Tube trains of Modern Warfare  3 with a less heavy-handed approach that employs spectacle--and there's no  shortage of that here--as more of a complement to its core combat. It's a game  that avoids falling in love with its own cinematic ambitions, allowing the  ruthless combat and well-paced encounters to take center stage over the plot.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="652" height="367" src="game-content-img/vga_codg_clip_image002.png" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/642/6422750/2364546-pix_001_566.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Ghosts is full of atmospheric touches, like bubbles discharging from  your gun when fired underwater.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's a  good thing, too, because the story is every bit a predictable tribute to  American military might. After the collapse of the Middle Eastern oil economy,  South America's oil-producing states join together to form an economic and  military superpower known as the Federation. Naturally, the Federation decides  to hijack a satellite weapon system and turn it against the United States. The  conflict that follows is one centered on the Ghosts, an enigmatic tier one task  force with a penchant for lethal efficiency and sweet skeleton masks.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  whole thing feels like a geopolitical Mad Lib, but a functional and rather  harmless one. Ghosts delivers<em>just</em>&nbsp;enough narrative to serve as a  catalyst for its whirlwind tour through global warzones, while resisting the  urge to club you over the head with plot twists and gratuitous shock-and-awe  moments. In many ways, Infinity Ward has crafted a story that reflects the  stoic nature of the Ghosts themselves: focused, efficient, and committed to the  task at hand.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  approach pays off: Ghosts features a terrific collection of shootouts and set  pieces, largely unburdened by the sensation that you're merely an extra in  someone else's adventure. At various points you go after a missile launch  center by tank and an offshore industrial facility by helicopter, each serving  as excellent examples of how well Call of Duty's zippy and responsive controls  can be applied toward massive, fully navigable battlefields. It's also a game  with a knack for crafting tense shootouts in unexpected locales, highlighted by  a brief jaunt into outer space that has you floating from one piece of debris  to the next, aiming the shots that will make a Federation soldier's helmet  decompress in a gruesome hiss.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_codg_clip_image003.png" alt=""></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Tank controls are unapologetically agile in Ghosts.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These  bombastic set pieces are complemented by more subdued moments, like a deep-sea  scuba mission that has you swimming through gorgeous reef formations while avoiding  enemies both shark and human. Then there are the more tightly scripted scenes,  like prowling through a dense jungle while using a motion tracker to spot  enemies, or rappelling down the side of a Caracas skyscraper as you quietly  snipe soldiers patrolling its interior. Moments like these further the game's  excellent pacing, serving as welcome palette cleansers after some of the more  spacious and chaotic battles.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It all  adds up to a campaign that follows the familiar rhythms of the series, but in a  more varied and generous way. There's a real willingness to let you stretch  your legs and soak up the spectacle, driven by the feeling that--for the most  part--you're the one at the center of the action.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">There  are some missteps. Using your pet dog to take out enemies serves as an  entertaining staple of the game's early missions, but this gameplay mechanic  completely disappears for the latter half of the campaign. Your AI squad mates  still have a habit of occasionally running in front of your gunfire as thought  you don't exist, and a few levels follow the bland corridor template a little  too closely. But those issues aside, this is an impressive campaign that uses  the series' winning formula as more of a roadmap than a shackle.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>This is an impressive  campaign that uses the series' winning formula as more of a roadmap than a  shackle.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Ghosts  is even more impressive on the next-gen hardware of the PlayStation 4. While  the current-gen versions are just as competent as ever, rendering the chaotic  shootouts at a smooth 60 frames per second, the PS4's next-gen artistry creates  a much more immersive battleground. Those effects are most noticeable in the  levels that emphasize lighting: the soft bokeh effects of floating embers on a  burning oil refinery, or the way moonlight refracts and ripples while  underwater. It's essentially the difference between a PC game running on high  versus low settings. Each version is functionally the same, but all those extra  effects add up to a more engrossing experience.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If  Ghosts' story campaign is an example of its developers leaving Modern Warfare  behind, its approach to co-op takes that trend one step further. Gone are the  Spec Ops missions from Infinity Ward's previous work, replaced by a new co-op  campaign dubbed Extinction. Much like Zombies in the Black Ops games,  Extinction presents a playful alternate reality where you and up to three  friends are dropped into a battle against fantastical enemies. But instead of  shambling zombies, you're fighting a swarm of buglike aliens. The way these  enemies scurry up the sides of buildings and burst forth from underground hives  changes the dynamic in a monumental way: you're still employing Call of Duty's  signature shooting mechanics, but you're doing so against an enemy whose  animalistic movement makes it much more imposing and unpredictable than your  average foot soldier.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_codg_clip_image004.png" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/642/6422750/2364584-360_exctinction.mov.still002.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Extinction's various progression systems make for a steep learning  curve, but boy is it fun.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Extinction  is an ambitious hybrid of tower defense,<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/left-4-dead/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Left 4 Dead</span></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/borderlands/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Borderlands</span></a>. You're drilling into alien hives as you move  through the backwoods and small-town streets of rural America, each drill site  its own standoff against swarms of incoming enemies who grow larger and nastier  as the campaign progresses. There's a class system that allows you to play  complementary roles, an in-game skill tree that lets you beef up your character  on the fly, and a scavenging system where taking the time to rummage through a  dumpster might reward you with a new weapon sight. There's also an economy that  encourages fun twists on teamwork, like the ability to pool your money together  to unlock a helicopter strike when things get really tough.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">None  of these ideas are remarkable on their own, but the way Extinction blends them  with Call of Duty's fast-paced action is tremendous fun. Throwing a hypno knife  at an acid-flinging scorpion to turn it into a friendly, debating whether to  buy a turret gun for yourself or a crate of incendiary ammo for your  team--Extinction is full of all these little moments and decisions that add up  to a stellar co-op experience. This is Call of Duty venturing as far outside  its comfort zone as it ever has, but the payoff is immense.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">A more  familiar experience can be found in Ghosts' competitive multiplayer. The  frantic pacing and close-quarters encounters are every bit as enjoyable as  they've ever been, augmented by contextual lean and running slide abilities  that make for more fluid transitions in and out of cover. Infinity Ward has  taken a delicate approach to the existing multiplayer progression, though a new  perk weighting system promotes better player balance while still giving you  plenty of ways to micromanage your loadouts.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">One of  the features that Ghosts introduces to multiplayer is a character customization  system that takes those abstract player levels and wraps a greater sense of  ownership around them. You can now create a roster of personalized soldiers,  each decked out in a wardrobe full of custom armor and equipment. Facial  designs, skin color, and gender are all options you can use to craft your own  characters, and then you take those creations one step further by leveling them  all up independently of one another. For a series that has long given you such  granular control over your weapons and abilities, it's nice to finally be able  to apply that same level of personalization to the characters themselves.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="570" height="321" src="game-content-img/vga_codg_clip_image006.png" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/642/6422750/2364587-pix_001_572.mov.still001.png"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Multiplayer maps have you fighting everywhere from Scottish castles to  Alaskan fishing villages.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">That  customization system is what drives the new Squads mode, a feature that pushes  Call of Duty eerily close to the realm of management sim. Squads is where you  take your custom characters and turn them into a full-blown team of AI  soldiers, leading your creations in competitive matches against teams designed  by your friends--even if those friends happen to be offline. It essentially  spreads the rewards of repeated prestiging out across different soldiers, giving  dedicated players a new kind of progression for the countless hours they will  spend leveling up.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Squads is clearly a feature designed for the  most hardcore Call of Duty players, but it's also a testament to just how deep  the well of competitive experiences has become.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Yet  Squads is hardly the only addition to Call of Duty's competitive landscape.  Ghosts introduces a number of clever multiplayer modes that keep a keen eye on  the series' strengths while taking a playful approach to how you can interact  with one another. Blitz is like a twist on American football: players dash  toward scoring zones on the other team's side of the map, warping right back to  safety if they're successful and becoming sitting ducks if they fail to  properly judge the scoring cooldown timer. Hunted takes a&nbsp;<em>Hunger Games</em>&nbsp;approach  to multiplayer design, giving players one handgun and 10 bullets to start and  forcing them to fight over randomized weapon drops that fall from the sky. And  then there's Grind, an evolution of Kill Confirmed that makes players take the  dog tags dropped by fallen enemies and run them back to a handful of specific  locations in order to bank points. Each of these game modes adds a devilish new  wrinkle to the multiplayer experience, taking an already exceptional collection  of competitive options and expanding them further.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">From  an exuberant campaign full of spectacle and variety to the way Extinction's  unpredictable aliens force you to use those targeting skills in entirely new  ways, Ghosts strikes an excellent balance between the familiar and the novel.  This is a game that's keenly aware of the series' strengths, but doesn't find  itself beholden to them. No matter what standard you apply, Call of Duty:  Ghosts is a terrific first-person shooter.</p>
