    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">A lot  of RTS gamers have been clamoring for a simplified Empire Earth over the past  couple of years, finding the first two releases in the series to be a mess of  units and eras as incomprehensible as a history textbook after it's been fished  out of a blender. So, welcome to Empire Earth III, a shot back at the critics  that answers complaints by dumbing the whole game down to utter dreck. While  the first two games in the series at least inspired love or hate, this new  arrival is so &quot;blah&quot; that it can only elicit a lot of &quot;What the  hell happened here?&quot; shrugs.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="486" height="389" src="game-content-img/vga_ee3_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2007/319/reviews/839476-938463_20071116_001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">All of the foppish voice samples don't exactly fit in with the crazed,  bloody melee combat. Although it is gratifying to see the jokers bragging about  camel farts turned into red smears on the landscape.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Still,  the design is more misguided than flat-out awful. Developer Mad Doc Software  probably started from a good place, working with the sensible idea that a lot  of the messy cross-epoch elements needed to be stripped away for the franchise  to truly compete with the likes of its Rise of Nations and Age of Empires  rivals. To accomplish this, the designers scrapped the old individual  civilization model and moved to a different route where you guide world  regions. Instead of picking the British, the Persians, the Americans, or the  like for campaign play, you choose a side from Western, Middle Eastern, and Far  Eastern empires that encompass basic stereotypes of their cultures. So the  Westerners are all about research and expensive, high-quality units. The  Easterners deal in huge numbers of infantry. And the Middle Easterners  specialize in cavalry and hit-and-run tactics. You can get past these  generalities only by playing skirmish mode against the computer or against  other human players online and selecting from handfuls of more traditional  nations like the US, North Korea, Switzerland, and Russia, and even then these  sides don't really differ from the others in their regional blocs.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This  concept gets across an imperial theme quite nicely, but it also simplifies  things too much. Basically, the standard dozen or so civs typically tricked out  with all sorts of varied units and specialties have been swapped out for what  amounts to a measly three of them that play a lot like one another anyhow. West  and East are structured similarly, with builders constructing traditional  Western city centers and Eastern ministries, warehouses, barracks, stables, and  so forth. Only the Middle East stands out somewhat, and this is mostly just for  portable buildings that can be unpacked without the assistance or any sort of  worker unit. You need to get into the future era to notice anything interesting  with these sides, as that's when you start seeing ideas like the Middle East's  cloaked factory and camouflaged revolutionary guard, and the East's  bioengineered units like the supersoldier and hulking mutant. Despite these  variances, the styles of play are nearly identical no matter what part of the  globe your empire calls home. You need to make accommodations for the blatant  specialties noted in the paragraph above (which basically means you need to  build cavalry with the Middle Easterners, research a lot of tech with the  Westerners, and crank out the infantry with the Easterners), but aside from  that this is all about the same old base building, resource gathering, and army  rushing.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Much  of the new world-domination mode of play feels equally tired. Mad Doc has  swiped a page from the Big Huge Studios playbook that the developer used to  make Rise of Nations, dropping the typical scripted campaign for a freeform  option where you try to conquer the globe. It plays as a cross-genre  experiment, with you making moves on a global map in turns and then seeing how  they play out in real-time skirmish maps. The only problem is that it's all  incredibly bland. Provinces are designated as imperial, economic, military, or  research sites based on the amount of each turn-based resource that the region  produces (you actually make this formal designation, but there generally isn't  much choice since you're given set numbers for each category), but there is  nothing to characterize these areas. You don't get to hear that, say, Southern  Europe is a great conquest because of its fertile farms and philosophical  Greeks; you just see that the province gets good numbers across the board. The  only plus is being able to custom-outfit your civilization with various  imperial, economy, and commerce world techs like roads and infrastructure,  supply lines, and superior intel. You get to directly play most of these techs  on provinces, too, which gives you a feeling of actually developing an empire.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="500" height="400" src="game-content-img/vga_ee3_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2007/319/reviews/839477-938463_20071116_002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Look familiar? The main world-domination mode of play is a straight riff  on Rise of Nations. It copies this design right to the letter. Well, save for  the 'good' part.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Still,  most of your time is spent in repetitive conquests of provinces occupied by  minor tribes drawn from all of history. These battles cannot be auto-resolved  as can scraps with the other empires in the game, so you spend an incredible  amount of time building the same base and army to slaughter the same packs of  heathens over and over again. Objectives are a bit varied in that you often  hook up with tribal allies or need to win over a new friend by doing him or her  a favor, but they pretty much always come down to you needing to build a big  army to wipe somebody out.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Artificial  intelligence provides little challenge in these engagements. Enemies put  together reasonable bases, yet never seem to build reasonable armies or attack  you in more than a halfhearted fashion. Take a little time to build even a  middling force and you'll be able to stomp all over most maps unopposed--if you  can find the bad guys, that is. Map design incorporates some of the most  irritating land features ever seen in an RTS. It's as if you're navigating  narrow corridors, not forests and plains. Valleys, cliffs, and rivers impede  your progress everywhere, forcing you to patrol every square inch of maps to  find enemy settlements. Horrific pathfinding makes these explorations even more  annoying. Armies hiccup in place whenever you issue new movement commands and  are so dumb that they can get hopelessly stuck if you ask them to turn around  in a tight spot like a dead-end valley.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="464" height="371" src="game-content-img/vga_ee3_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2007/319/reviews/839478-938463_20071116_003.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">How these elephant archers got into ancient Western Europe, we'll never  know.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Everything  in world-domination campaigns is also mixed up when it comes to time and place.  You start in the proper geographic location for your civilization, but nobody  else seems to be in their proper places. So if you begin a campaign as the  West, you kick off your conquering in ancient Western Europe. So far, so good.  But then you can immediately encounter an Olmec tribe in Britain, an Asian  settlement in the vicinity of Spain, and Knights Templar guarding a lost tomb  next to a pack of elephant archers in what appears to be Germany. So much for  the global scope and historical realism; the game seems to be even more of an  historical mash-up then any other RTS.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Mix-ups  are also common with unit types. As with previous Empire Earth games, units are  often jumbled together from various eras. Here, however, this tendency seems  even more pronounced due to the use of just five eras (ancient, medieval,  colonial, modern, and future). It's common to find all sorts of bizarre units  marching side by side. So if your sensibilities are offended by troops wielding  Gatling guns and arquebuses on the same battlefields, give Empire Earth III a  pass. If this isn't enough to turn off armchair historians, numerous goofy  units with no basis in reality should certainly do the trick. The Middle  Easterners are probably the biggest offenders here, with camels that can lay a  hurting on enemies due to a special stench attack and a hero prophet unit that  can call forth a plague of frogs. While there is a place for such units in an  RTS, they don't fit in a game seemingly designed to be a more serious, more  authentic take on conquering the globe.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  developer's questionable sense of taste and humor is also on display in the  visuals and sound. The overall graphic design of the game leans toward the  cartoonish, with a brightly colored palette that often renders units in pastel  hues more appropriate for a teen girl's bedroom décor than an army's. This at  least helps make buildings distinctive, as splashes of color let you tell one  civilization's settlement from another at a glance. Of course, there are  basically only three of them, so it's not like you've got a lot of  architectural styles to memorize. The audio component of the game soars well  past cartoony and into stupid. Units acknowledge orders with nothing but cheap  jokes. Knights make snarky little comments about &quot;being right behind  you…way behind you,&quot; and usabari camel riders crack jokes such as &quot;I  am like a camel fart--loud and dangerous.&quot; As you can tell by these  winning examples, the lines in the game aren't funny. And they're much less  amusing after you've been forced to listen to them a few hundred times over the  course of a skirmish. Troops seem to get stuck like skipping records at times,  too, and often incessantly repeat the same dialogue every time you issue a move  command. This just makes a bad situation even worse.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="428" height="343" src="game-content-img/vga_ee3_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2007/319/reviews/839479-938463_20071116_004.jpg">B</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">izarre future units like the East's genetically altered hulking mutants  and supersoldiers add character, if not credibility, to later game battles.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">We  could get into the derivative, buggy multiplayer, the frequent crashes, and the  demanding system requirements that bring a Crysis-conquering system to its  knees, but what's the point? Earlier Empire Earth games were acquired tastes  that not everybody liked. Now, in an attempt to reach out to the masses, the  developer has given us a game that nobody will like. The first two releases in  the series were overwhelming, but they're apt to inspire fond memories in  anyone who makes the mistake of picking up this lame new sequel.</p>
