    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Destiny  prefers telling the same pedestrian stories time and time again, hoping to  transfix you with its rinse-and-repeat pace and ply you with the possibility of  better loot, rather than with gameplay diversity that gives you good reason to  hope for surprises on the horizon. Cooperative missions--some of them occurring  within the story, and others, called strikes, occurring outside of it--are  primarily about doors and computers. Your robotic companion, an orb voiced by&nbsp;<em>Game  of Thrones</em>&nbsp;actor Peter Dinklage, hacks into a lot of them, and it is  your job to shoot aliens hailing from various galactic races while he drones  the occasional word of encouragement. (&quot;I'll work faster,&quot; he says,  in a bored not-quite-robot, not-quite human delivery that, like most of  Destiny, lacks energy and charisma.) The fight may end with an elite enemy, or  even a giant boss, that absorbs many minutes worth of bullet fire before it  falls, just in time for Dinklage-bot to announce his success and open the door  that leads to another firefight and another terminal to hack into.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  repetition may not bother you at first. It's easy to be taken in by Destiny's  gorgeous shell, a slick and striking wrapper that surrounds the hollow and  unimaginative game languishing inside of it. Everything about the game screams  &quot;big budget,&quot; and Destiny's versions of Earth, Mars, the Moon, and  Venus are meant to be ogled and appreciated. Outside of the pockets of alien  invaders and the dropships that bring you even more strange entities to annihilate,  these are sterile places, more like stunning screensavers than dynamic domains.  But what views Destiny offers! From the golden-red sands of Mars rise rocky  crags and abandoned facilities that speak to a history the story offers too few  glimpses into. On Venus, you might hesitate to step foot into streams of  unknown purple liquid that couldn't exist on the planet as we currently  understand it. These sights are awe-inspiring, though Destiny takes a  &quot;look but don't touch&quot; approach to them. That purple liquid? It's  fine to walk through. Destiny's environments are oblivious to your presence,  more cold and indifferent than hostile and mysterious.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Make  no mistake: Destiny's mechanical basics are, for the most part, superb.  Interacting with this online-only shooter is a delight. The confident shooting  model, the intuitive menus, the unblemished frame rate--all of these elements  make for a fantastic foundation to build a worthy dynamic multiplayer shooter  upon. Pulse rifles shoot their rhythmic barrages with great power, and charging  up a fusion rifle and releasing its payload is akin to holding your breath and  then expelling it in one rewarding sigh. The game's best combat feature,  however, might be its melee attack, regardless of which of the game's three  all-too-similar classes you choose. Destiny nails that special,  difficult-to-define&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;comprised of fluid controls,  excellent collision detection, and awesome technology that makes every action  silky and responsive. You can leap and glide through the air, a mechanic that  gives Destiny a sense of freedom that matches its open spaces, and helps you  escape danger when encounters get tough.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="500" height="282" src="game-content-img/vga_destiny_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2654739-000164315.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Why does the moon have the same gravity as earth? Because &quot;The  Traveler,&quot; I guess.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="480" height="269" src="game-content-img/vga_destiny_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2654747-2014090917183840.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  most powerful foes put up a decent fight, using cover to their advantage,  protecting themselves with shields, or assailing you en masse. If only you got  access to the aliens' intriguing firearms instead of being confined to the  game's excellent but bog-standard arsenal. Luckily, you gain access to  different types of slow-to-replenish grenades, and a few superpowers, such as  the warlock's magical area-of-effect projectile, that take even longer to  recharge. The extraterrestrial races you battle come in all shapes and sizes  and yank their names from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rulebook: wizard,  minotaur, harpy, and the like. Tearing down the alien hordes can be enjoyable.  You set the sights of your machine gun on a chain of thralls and mow them down  while a troop of acolytes fires on you from a distance. The stage is set for an  electrifying showdown.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  disappointment of Destiny is that it fails to capitalize on the possibilities.  Story missions and strike missions have you taking to Destiny's broad and  beautiful settings with a friend or two at your side, but breadth isn't the  games primary calling card: it's repetition. Excellent basics are betrayed by  half-baked ideas stretched into hours of slow-paced and redundant tasks that  have you asking yourself, &quot;Hey, isn't this the same canyon I just raced  through on my handy speeder a few moments ago? Hey, didn't I just cross this  hill 10 minutes ago, and 20 minutes ago, and an hour ago?&quot; It's tempting  to compare Destiny to full-fledged massively multiplayer role-playing games,  but doing so reveals how much more diverse typical MMOGs really are. By  contrast, Destiny makes no attempt to mask the sameness of its primary tasks.  To pursue new content in Destiny is to fondly recall a trophy you've already  won. It's nice to relive the victory, but new celebrations require new  victories, not home movies of the old ones.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="576" height="325" src="game-content-img/vga_destiny_clip_image005.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2654740-2014090920222946.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Headshots are helpful, but goblins are best shot in their middles!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Destiny  tries to mask its repetitiveness with a vague story that uses more  cryptoscientific nonsense than an entire season of&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em>, and  grants your character so meaningless an identity, and so little dialogue, that  he or she might as well be a silent protagonist. &quot;Lure out the Vex Gate  Lord that protects the Endless Steps and bring its head back to the  Awoken,&quot; says the mission text, making you ponder phenomena you know next  to nothing about. What is the role of the Awoken in this solar system? What is  the historical relevance of the Endless Steps? What purpose drives the Vex, and  indeed, what do the Awoken hope to learn?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">I don't  have the answers.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  story hints at its potential about halfway through, when you meet two of  Destiny's few non-Dinklage characters, both of whom wear dramatic costumes and  fill their speech with pregnant pauses worthy of the best Bond villains. Alas,  Destiny wastes the opportunity to develop a mystery worth caring about, and  instead reverts to more fetch quests, then follows them up with a manipulative  ending that reminds you that the game's superlative orchestral soundtrack does  far more work in establishing this world's tone than the mediocre writing ever  does. To be fair, some of the item descriptions, and lore-heavy explanations  you can read on Destiny's official website, fill in some narrative gaps. But  even many of those explanations require you to meet certain thresholds so that  you can unlock them. Developer Bungie doesn't take responsibility for its own  story; instead, it passes the responsibility for learning the story on to you,  but never infuses its game with the richness of tone that might inspire you to  seek answers.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="426" height="240" src="game-content-img/vga_destiny_clip_image007.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/416/4161502/2654743-2014091018241101.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Stop staring at the scenery. There are people to shoot!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">There's  loot, of course, much of it in the form of new weapons, armor, and blueprints  called engrams, which you redeem at a hub called the Tower. You share this  space with a dozen-plus other players, most of whom talk to the vendors there  without concern for other players. If you're used to the barrage of loot you  receive while playing games like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/borderlands/"><span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Borderlands</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/diablo-iii/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Diablo III</span></a>, be sure to prepare for Destiny's slower pace of  doling out rewards. It's befitting that meaningful new stuff doesn't come that  frequently, given how Destiny on the whole feels like a standard-sized experience  stretched entirely too thin. Once you leave the tale behind, which happens  about 15 hours into Destiny should you play story missions that match your  level, your desire for loot is the biggest determining factor when deciding  whether to stick with Destiny or to jump ship.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">I'm  not sure I will return, in spite of the promise of a larger-scale&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/destinys-endgame-raids-only-playable-with-friends-/1100-6421401/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">raid event</span></a>&nbsp;soon to come. Each  automatic rifle is more or less like the last, and the various passive upgrades  do little to spur my interest. Much of Destiny feels underdone and  underthought. There's no scaling system in place to allow players of  too-disparate levels to play together, or even to draw you back to lower-level  areas. The presence of players outside of your fireteam is more window dressing  than vital mechanic, particularly if you level up in ways that don't involve  performing patrol missions, which return you to previously explored areas to  perform random, boring quests. It is on patrol missions that you stumble upon  public events, which draw nearby players together to vanquish greater foes,  like a hardy spider tank that soaks up rockets and heavy fire. Given Destiny's  habit of delivering small-scale action in a large-scale world, it's a shame  it's so easy to miss out on these events: they are one of the few elements that  make Destiny spring to life.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>Destiny prefers telling  the same stories time and time again, hoping to transfix you with its  rinse-and-repeat pace and ply you with the possibility of better loot, rather  than with gameplay diversity that intimates surprises hovering on the horizon.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="269" src="game-content-img/vga_destiny_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static4.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/416/4161502/2654745-2014090916254422.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  crucible is where the action heats up, even if it rarely erupts with true  thrills. This is where Destiny's competitive multiplayer lurks, and it's  entirely competent. A post-<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/halo-combat-evolved/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Halo</span></a>&nbsp;Bungie reminds us once again of its mastery  of level design, with intricate maps of various sizes that get put to good use  in four different modes. Six-member free-for-all deathmatch finds its stride on  maps that recall the winding corridors and central combat arenas of<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/unreal-tournament/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Unreal Tournament</span></a>, and gives you a good reason to wield a shotgun if  you've gotten accustomed to equipping a sniper rifle in that secondary weapon  slot. This six-player deathmatch also has a team variation, on which teams of  three hunt each other at a more thoughtful pace than the other modes provide.  It's best to stick with friends for this one: communication is key, as is  carefully surveying the area before making moves that could put you directly in  an opponent's line of sight. It's Destiny's tensest mode, but one that  strangers can easily disrupt. Typical team deathmatches involve twice as many  players on maps that sometimes allow you to leap into one of Destiny's two  combat vehicles. (Oh, how I wish these vehicles had been put to better use  outside of the crucible.)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Control  mode, in which players seek to secure specified control points, is the most  enjoyable, however, allowing both lone wolves and focused teams to contribute.  There are some issues here, such as the way the auto-targeting can cause a  passing opponent to grab your targeting reticle when you are trying to fire at  a different target. However, competitive play proves itself a worthy way of  leveling up and earning access to gear otherwise unavailable. The maps  themselves eventually reveal subtle but clever details that become important  tactical considerations. Those large space-age doors take a moment to open, and  do so loudly enough that you might very well signal your approach. Mounted guns  offer a view of the exact right amount of real estate, making a stationary  gunner potentially valuable but by no means overpowered. If any attack is  overpowered, it might be the arc blade, the bladedancer subclass's super  ability, which cuts through you like a knife through space butter. (It's the  gunslinger's golden gun ability that I most often succumb to, however.)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You  might summarize Destiny by the way in which it wraps up its story. Once the  final, hackneyed closing scene finishes, fireteam members are awarded the same  weapon, regardless of class, and a handful of currency. This reminder of how  wholly unspecial you are is the big finale of a lavishly produced but troubled  game that excels in the basics but lacks creativity and heart. It is  role-playing grind in shooter form--an empty house built on a firm foundation.</p>
