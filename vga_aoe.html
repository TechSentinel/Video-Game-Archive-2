    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This  is an impressive feat for a real-time strategy game that came out over a decade  ago, especially when you consider that the official multiplayer matchmaking  service was shut down years ago. A prettier version of AOEII with easier  multiplayer matchmaking and mod support (via Steam's servers and Steam  Workshop) is a solid idea. Unfortunately, Hidden Path's HD edition of Ensemble  Studios' classic RTS suffers from a variety of bugs and missed opportunities.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="541" height="338" src="game-content-img/vga_aoe_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2013/105/reviews/2035781-706762_20130416_001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Nobody expects the Spanish cannon galleon fleet!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">AOEII:HD's  gameplay is instantly familiar to practically anyone who has ever played a  real-time strategy game focused on the big picture. This fast-paced game has  you exploiting natural resources, constructing beautiful wonders and formidable  castles, and advancing from the Dark Ages to the much more dignified-sounding  Imperial Age. Along the way, you use the tried-and-true rock-paper-scissors  formula (pointy sticks kill cavalry, villagers kill sheep, and so on) to  violently evict other players from the map. There is a lot of depth to  AOEII:HD, because all of the 18 playable nations have unique bonuses, units,  and tech trees. For example, Frankish castles are cheap, Turks field awesome  gun-powder units early on, and the Huns don't need houses to support their  population. There are also randomly generated and real-world maps to play on,  as well as numerous game modes, including a pacifist game type where the first  player to complete a wonder wins. Because of the variety of victory conditions  and diverse powers for each nation, there are a lot of ways to play, and excel,  in Age of Empires II HD.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">However,  Hidden Path missed opportunities to improve on AOEII's gameplay. As things  stand, you cannot give move-attack orders; dragging a box over a mass of units  selects both villagers and troops; and it's impossible to queue up a mixture of  units and research at the same building. AI pathfinding also needs some work.  For instance, villagers ordered to travel to a lumber camp located in plain  sight 700 yards away over open country may inexplicably decide to take a scenic  route through a canyon populated by ravenous jaguars. These are examples of  flaws that could have been resolved, but increasing the maximum population  limit from 200 to 500 is the only noticeable change made in terms of gameplay.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="493" height="308" src="game-content-img/vga_aoe_clip_image004_0000.jpg" alt="http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2013/105/reviews/2035782-706762_20130416_002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">At least the old cheats work.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  main difference between AOEII:HD and AOEII is the HD version's use of Steam for  multiplayer matchmaking, which, given the size of Steam's user base, is  significantly more convenient than programs like GameRanger. You can hop into a  random game from the lobby browser and, theoretically, enjoy fantastic  experiences. The game is highly enjoyable for both friendly comp stomps and  player-vs.-player games. Of course, some people rage quit after accusing you of  cheating simply because of your Byzantine fire ships' predilection for sinking  undefended fishing fleets.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Still,  a victory is a victory. A match might involve you sending a series of  impressive (and foolish) Aztec human wave attacks against Viking castles and  longboats defending the river crossings separating your peoples. Untold  hundreds of digital Aztecs could die trying to destroy the proud Norsemen's  wonder. When the stars are aligned correctly and everything works, AOEII:HD's  multiplayer is exceptionally fun.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Sadly,  such experiences are rare because AOEII:HD's multiplayer is currently extremely  buggy. You could encounter out-of-sync errors, random crashes to desktop mere  moments into the game, complete strangers entering friends-only games, and  excessive lag. Another recurring problem is that, often, when someone drops,  everyone else gets stuck on a vote screen, and nothing happens even if the  players unanimously vote to continue the game. Furthermore, when you are using  two monitors, AOEII:HD runs so poorly that even the single-player modes are  practically unplayable. Hidden Path has released a few updates over the past  week and fixed some of the problems. The lag in two-player games is less  pronounced and some achievements work now. While it's fortunate that Hidden  Path has been working on some of these problems, it is inexcusable that the  game was released in this state.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">While  AOEII:HD's multiplayer experience is a mess, at least the nine single-player  campaigns work fine. Each campaign includes at least six scenarios, and most of  those take at least 30 minutes to an hour to finish, so you could easily spend  dozens of hours playing the single-player campaigns. Of course, quantity isn't  the same thing as quality, but some individual scenarios are so enjoyable that  they stick in your memory. One example is the scenario in Attila the Hun's  campaign in which you extort tribute from the Eastern Roman Empire by raiding  settlements near Constantinople. You can even try to sack that heavily  fortified city if you'd like.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Another  memorable scenario has you leading the Vikings as they run away from Norway's  many hungry wolves in search of a new life across the sea. You need to raid  Scotland and conquer Greenland before traveling on to North America. Finally,  you must build a proper colony in the face of constant attacks by the native  Skraelings, who think they own the place. The campaigns don't make up for the  woeful state of AOEII:HD's multiplayer, but they are great fun, especially if  you've never played them before.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Despite  the name, AOEII:HD doesn't scream &quot;high definition.&quot; The game  supports higher resolutions, but there are already several lovely graphics mods  on Steam Workshop that look better than the base game. Vanilla AOEII:HD is  attractive, but (original developer) Ensemble's artists deserve most of the  credit. Major historical structures, such as the Dome of the Rock, Torre del  Oro, and Hagia Sophia, are depicted in stunningly gorgeous detail. In fact,  practically all the structures are full of interesting details, such as  seagulls circling the docks, goods arranged for sale at the markets, and swords  and practice dummies visible in the courtyard of a barracks. In terms of sound,  the HD edition has added no new material and only includes the soundtrack from  the Conquerors expansion. Thankfully, you can find all of the missing tracks on  Steam Workshop.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="466" height="291" src="game-content-img/vga_aoe_clip_image006_0000.jpg" alt="http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2013/105/reviews/2035784-706762_20130416_004.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If you're having Turk problems, I feel bad for you, son.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Age of  Empires II: HD Edition has enormous potential. After all, the base game is  still enjoyable and visually attractive (excepting the units that were never  beautiful), and you can smoothly download content from the Steam Workshop.  However, the HD edition fails to improve on the original's gameplay in any way,  and numerous bugs mar what should be an excellent multiplayer experience.  Hopefully, Hidden Path will eventually fix the problems so that epic  eight-player matches with hundreds of units on each side can entertain strategy  fans until our civilization, like ancient Rome, falls and fades into the annals  of history.</p>
