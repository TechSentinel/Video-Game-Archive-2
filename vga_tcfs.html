    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  decades to come may be full of unknown potential for wondrous inventions, but  in the gaming realm, the future is old hat. Invisibility, X-ray vision, and  miniature floating cameras are modern marvels that have long since become  familiar. Though these tools are potent in Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future  Soldier, there's precious little novelty in your futuristic arsenal, and this  can make you feel like you're undertaking missions you've run many times  before. So is Future Soldier just another by-the-book third-person shooter?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Fortunately  not. Though there's plenty of familiarity to be found here, Future Soldier's  brand of stealthy action and streamlined teamwork gives it a distinct appeal.  The lengthy campaign lets you wield your AI allies like autonomous weapons;  their guns are yours to command, but they handle their own maneuvers, pushing  the action along at a slick pace. Replacing them with your fellow humans brings  its own challenges and rewards, as does facing off against said humans in the  lively competitive multiplayer modes. Though it's more of a product of the past  than a vision of the future, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier is a robust package  that provides plenty of satisfying ways to exercise your itchy trigger finger.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">In the  campaign, you play as the ghosts, a four-man team of elite soldiers. Cutscenes  and mid-mission dialogue combine to create a nice sense of camaraderie among  the crew, and hackneyed archetypes are downplayed in favor of more understated  characterization. Personalities are colored in during small moments, like a  song streaming out of earbuds, a fleeting facial expression, and a conversation  about used trucks. Interactions with other military personnel reveal how  isolated the ghosts are from the soldiers they break bread with and how  oblivious those soldiers are to this fact. This segregation creates a  connection among the ghosts that is a refreshing change from the familiar  &quot;bonds forged on the crucible of combat&quot; trope.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="553" height="312" src="game-content-img/vga_tcfs_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2012/141/reviews/1944101-988969_20120521_007.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Line 'em up and knock 'em down.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">On the  field of battle, the ghosts try to emulate their namesakes, moving silently  with the aid of slick optical camouflage that dissolves if you jog, sprint, or  fire your weapon. Staying stealthy is often a mission requirement, and even  when it isn't, avoiding detection gives you a distinct advantage. It's easy to  maneuver unseen, and you spend a lot of time silently eliminating foes. Stealth  melee kills and suppressed weapons are your basic tools, but the key mechanic  is the sync shot. Spotting enemies through your scope or tagging them from  aloft with your aerial drone, you can designate up to four targets for you and  your squad to eliminate in one fell swoop. To execute, simply open fire on your  own target, or issue the command with a press of the right bumper.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's a  neat trick, and the seconds of slo-mo that follow are a welcome flourish that  allow you to silently mop up more than the few targeted foes. Using sync shots  to eliminate enemies is pleasing and relatively easy, thanks to the array of  detection methods at your disposal. Drones, sensor grenades, and a few flavors  of optical gadgetry give you plenty of ways to detect nearby foes. As long as  no one sees the dead bodies, no one gets suspicious, and many situations lay  out foes in discrete, easily sync-shot-able groups.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Only in  later levels do you encounter larger groups that put your coordination skills  to the test. You must now take into account multiple lines of sight and  interlocking movement patterns, as well as calibrate the exact speed at which  you can tag and take down a new set of targets. Methodically carving your way  through these scenarios is very satisfying, and you might even find yourself  choosing to reload checkpoints when you are discovered, even if you aren't  forced to. Though an alert doesn't always bring your mission to a close,  challenging yourself to maintain stealth is usually more engaging and fun than  blasting your way through.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="587" height="331" src="game-content-img/vga_tcfs_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2012/141/reviews/1944106-988969_20120521_012.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's important to remember that you are camouflaged, not invisible.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Aside  from sync shot orders, your AI allies are mostly autonomous. They follow your  lead but move, take cover, and engage alerted targets on their own. They are  very reliable, but they are prone to a number of unrealistic behaviors that can  hamper your immersion. Shooting effectively through multiple thick walls,  sprinting past enemies while maintaining camouflage, or failing to acquire a  marked target in line of sight are all intermittent AI oddities.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Fortunately,  these AI issues rarely have an adverse effect on your progress. Yet regardless  of how careful you are, things are going to get loud. Open firefights provide  good opportunities to use non-suppressed weapons like light machine guns and  shotguns, as well as deadly ordnance like frag and incendiary grenades. The AI  is aggressive, but not reckless (to borrow a phrase from the ghost leader), and  they throw grenades, flank, and suppress your position with vigor. The latter  action can trigger a disorienting camera movement that temporarily prevents you  from returning fire, a nice change from the clouded field of view seen in other  shooters.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">As  long as you stay behind cover, dodge grenades, and shoot sharply, you can  progress through these encounters without too much hassle. The suggested weapon  loadout is always up to the task, though Future Soldier does offer an extensive  weapon customization mode before each campaign mission. Almost every part of  the gun can be analyzed and swapped out for another that favors different  attributes, though it takes some time to unlock the more intriguing hardware.  Each component is rendered in loving detail, and it's fun to watch the gun  spring apart into fragments and then reassemble. You do all this tinkering with  the controller or with the Kinect, though the latter is strictly a novelty and  almost no help at all when it comes to testing your weapon on the firing range.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Out in  the field, your guns fire with realistic reports and bullets impact targets  with a squishy thud. Yet while the gunplay is competently put together, the  cover-to-cover firefights rarely coalesce into something truly exciting.  There's a workmanlike quality to the action that makes you yearn for the thrill  of a sync shot, though some set-piece moments help liven things up. Slow-motion  breaching maneuvers and on-rails hostage extractions add some dramatic flair, and  the mission with a donkey-sized robot (the Warhound) provides some explosive  kicks.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="557" height="314" src="game-content-img/vga_tcfs_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2012/141/reviews/1944096-988969_20120521_002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Your other arm is currently devoted to hostage extraction.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Each  campaign mission presents four challenges to overcome in order to unlock extra  weaponry, and striving to achieve them is a good way to keep things more  interesting. You have to tweak your arsenal to pull some of them off, or just  bring a few friends along to help your cause. In fact, some seem to all but  require additional human players, and you can have one local or up to three  online teammates. Coordinating sync shots and advancing on enemies is more  enjoyable with a human crew, and there's also a horde mode in which you (and up  to three friends) must defend an outpost from waves of enemies. Escalating weapon  loadouts, wave perks, and a variety of gear help you make your stand as things  get tougher, and the higher waves pose a stiff challenge to even the sharpest  ghosts.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">There's  also a lively challenge to be found in competitive multiplayer, in which two teams  of up to six players can compete in a variety of modes. As in the campaign, you  can die quickly if caught out, so cover is a powerful ally. But with the  exception of the one-life-per-round Siege mode, respawns happen frequently  enough that the penalty for death is not very severe, which allows for more  brazen tactics. This gives things a more hectic feel, especially in Conflict  mode when the objectives regularly shift the focal point of the battle.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="569" height="321" src="game-content-img/vga_tcfs_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2012/141/reviews/1944099-988969_20120521_005.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Not on my watch.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Your  firearm skills serve you well, but so does reconnaissance. Stunning an enemy  instead of killing him and then hacking his data feed may be risky and  time-consuming, but the resulting reveal of enemy positions is a very potent  reward, especially in the bomb-transporting Saboteur mode. Using your tech to  gain an advantage is gratifying, and success in multiplayer earns you levels  and new gear for whichever of the three classes you are playing as at the time.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  competitive action evolves as more players bring more gadgetry and guns into the  fray, adding some nice diversity, and even the lengthy campaign provides some  good reasons to return to it after you've seen it through. Though the standard  gunplay isn't very exciting, stealthly skill shots and diverse combat scenarios  provide a lot of entertaining and satisfying moments. The action rarely  transcends present-day standards, but Ghost Recon: Future Soldier proves that  there is still a lot of fun to be found on the battlefields of the future.</p>
