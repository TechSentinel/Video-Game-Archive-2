    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  campaign is the first of many of these delights. You may have heard that  Starcraft II features only a single campaign: that of the human faction known  as the Terrans. One of the game's few disappointments is that the other two  factions--the Protoss and the Zerg--don't get their day in the sun, so if  you're a newcomer who wants to prove your superiority (or inferiority) online,  don't expect the campaign to prepare you for the potential onslaught. But the  campaign is hardly a one-note wonder, offering loads of variety, including an  entire set of missions that divulges important story elements from an entirely  different perspective. Yet even outside of those devious missions, you  accomplish diverse and interesting tasks throughout the story. In one early  mission, lava periodically rises onto the mainland, posing a threat to any  units not positioned on high ground. In another, an exploding sun causes a  deadly wall of flame to steadily push you across the map. From one mission to  the next, there's an intriguing new development that keeps you devoted to  seeing what surprise is waiting for you next.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Many  of these missions are RTS staples: Lead these small groups of units down this  linear path, defend this specific structure, and so on. Yet Starcraft II gives these  tasks meaningful context. Take the very first mission, for example. It's a very  easy training mission, but one side objective has you take down holograms  displaying emperor Arcturus Mengsk's political propaganda. After destroying  these displays and arriving at your objective, the citizens rise up and join  you, and you get a sense of the Terran dominion's heavy hand, as well as the  peoples' desire to be freed from tyranny. A later mission puts you in control  of an enormous mech and sends you off on a fiery rampage. Controlling a single  unit in an RTS for any period of time isn't always fun, but because of how the  mission is presented and its meaning within the story, this simple single-unit  romp feels completely satisfying.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="620" height="361" src="game-content-img/vga_starcraft2_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/209/1547948-939643_20100729_016.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Jim could use a shot of caffeine.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Of  course, the story plays out in more ways than simple mission objectives. You  closely follow brooding freedom fighter Jim Raynor as he struggles to fight off  the threat of the alien Zerg race, topple the manipulative Emperor Mengsk from  his throne, and come to terms with his own guilt over the fate of Sarah  Kerrigan. If you're headed into this sequel without any knowledge of prior  events, you need not worry that you'll be in the dark: the campaign does an  excellent job of filling in backstory even as the current narrative unfolds.  The plot is uncomplicated, and the dialogue is action-movie simple, but  Starcraft II's excellent cinematics, evocative soundtrack, and top-notch voice  acting have a way of keeping you glued to the screen. Hero Jim Raynor is a  strong but troubled man. You hear it in his resolute drawl, and the way the  soundtrack signals his presence with its telltale twangs; you see it in the  dark, moody way he's so often lit. The game punctuates its most poignant and  thrilling moments with fantastic prerendered cutscenes, but even the in-engine  cutscenes pull you in, thanks to expressive facial animations and plenty of  humorous winks and nods scattered about.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You do  more than just watch cutscenes in between missions, however. This downtime is  your chance to get to know the crew of Raynor's battlecruiser, the Hyperion. In  a style similar to that of an adventure game, when you click on various  characters and items on the screen, you might be rewarded with a short  cutscene, a clever quip from a nerdy scientist, or a broadcast from a  not-so-fair-and-balanced news agency. But these interludes aren't just for  clicking and watching: You also upgrade and enhance your units and structures  in important ways. By spending research points you earn on particular missions,  you will gain access to permanent upgrades and new units normally associated  with the Zerg and Protoss factions. However, these are either/or propositions:  choosing one research option will lock you out of the other choice offered. You  also earn currency to spend on other permanent upgrades or on mercenary units  you can immediately summon to the battlefield. By their very nature, these  options give the campaign replay value--value that's further elevated by a few  occasions on which you must make a choice during the campaign that determines  the course of minor story elements. These decisions don't just bring narrative  consequences, however; they also determine which of two or more potential  missions you must complete and have further impact on what units you might have  access to or the enemy units you will face.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="558" height="349" src="game-content-img/vga_starcraft2_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/209/1547953-939643_20100729_021.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The Protoss mothership may look imposing, but it's hardly an automatic  win.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">And so  the campaign is certainly not an incomplete game, in spite of the focus on a  single faction. The structure of the campaign provides a strong argument for  playing the entire thing from the beginning all over again or, at least, from  an early save game. Furthermore, the campaign is of a goodly length, lasting 15  hours or more depending on how quickly you blow through missions, how much time  you spend tooling around on the Hyperion, and what difficulty level you choose.  But there's also another factor that will keep you coming back: an entire  metagame in which you earn in-game achievements for accomplishing very specific  tasks. Of course, such achievements are nothing new; Xbox Live, the PlayStation  Network, Steam, and even Blizzard's own World of Warcraft have made good use of  abstract rewards to keep players dedicated. But these achievements are woven  through every aspect of the game, from the campaign to the multiplayer, and in  turn, these achievements are broadcast to your in-game friends on the  all-important Battle.net online service that serves as Starcraft II's primary  interface.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This  Battle.net interface has its drawbacks. In order to play the game at all, you  must create a Battle.net account and associate it with your game key. To earn  achievements--even those in the single-player modes--you must be signed in to  your account, which means always remaining online. (Fortunately, you can play  the campaign as a guest when not signed into your Battle.net account, though  you won't earn any rewards that way.) And though you can indicate that you are  unavailable and block other users, you cannot make yourself invisible to the  players on your friends list if you aren't in a social mood. Starcraft II is an  intrinsically social experience. When friends receive achievements, you get a  notification, which might drive a bit of friendly competition. You unlock and  select from various user icons, which identify you to your friends and to your  multiplayer rivals. You select which achievements you want to show off to  anyone viewing your profile. And if you aren't sure which of your friends might  be playing, the game will search your Facebook friends list and automatically  send an invite to anyone with a Battle.net account. The social integration, the  achievement notifications, and the intuitive and smooth interface make  Battle.net--usually--a positive way of interfacing with Starcraft II.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">StarCraft  II is a competitive game of the highest order, and as such, it offers a fully  featured online experience that is as thrilling as it is grueling. It begins  with choosing the faction that best suits your play style. Every race offers  versatility within its own units, and any number of strategies could be key to  your success. If you play as Protoss, you might become enamored with the  ominous flying void rays, which destroy both ground and air units with a  focused beam of energy. But an enemy with a ready counter (say, Terran marines)  might take advantage of the void's need to charge up before it fires. The Zerg  are well known for facilitating rush tactics, but if you face a zergling rush  as a Terran, flame-spewing hellions may be your answer. There are great  opportunities for satisfying micromanagement with each race, whether that means  using the Protoss phoenix to lift ground units into the sky or transforming  soaring Terran vikings into assault walkers. Each of the three factions possesses  its own strengths and weaknesses, but there are so many different ways of  approaching the battle that you need to stay flexible, scout the enemy, and  respond accordingly.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These  units and strategies make Starcraft II very similar to its predecessor. You  won't see the drastic changes seen in the most recent Dawn of War and Command  &amp; Conquer games; Starcraft II is a highly traditional RTS. But you  shouldn't discount the tweaks, the minor changes, and the additions and  subtractions that differentiate this sequel from what came before. The  larvaelike Protoss reaver, for example, was jettisoned in favor of the looming  colossus, a thin-legged walker that razes ground units with a buzzing beam. (A  group of them climbing over a short cliff into your base is a terrifying  sight.) The Terran thor is a mechanical mass of limbs and missile launchers  that can take on both air and ground units. (Their unit responses also sound  suspiciously like Arnold Schwarzenegger.) On the Zerg side, nydus worms allow  quick underground travel, and unlike the original game's nydus canals, they can  be placed anywhere in your line of sight. Starcraft II will surely see some  unit tweaks in the coming months, but even at this stage, the factions seem  remarkably balanced, and every unit has an appropriate reply. You might miss  your favorite units from the original, but the new ones are every bit as fun to  use.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="567" height="354" src="game-content-img/vga_starcraft2_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/209/1547939-939643_20100729_007.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Void rays are appealing to use and awesome to watch in battle, but they  aren't invulnerable.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  amount of content available in online play (and in offline play in skirmish  mode) is remarkable. There are dozens of maps that support up 12 players, and  matches can be tailored in the usual ways--grouping players into different  teams, setting the game speed, and so on. You might group up with friends and  conspire to take down an all-AI team or try your hand at a desperate six-player  free-for-all. However, to show off your strategizing prowess, you'll want to  get into ranked league matches, which is as easy as playing a series of games  to determine which league you'll be placed in and then inching your way to the  top. If this sounds intimidating, don't worry; you can take part in up to 50  slow-paced preliminary matches to get yourself prepared for the big boys.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If you  need further practice, you can always take on the AI in a stand-alone skirmish,  and numerous AI difficulty levels let you set your own pace. There are also a  series of challenges designed to get you familiar with each faction's units, as  well as the intricacies of hotkeys, rush defense, and other gameplay elements.  These challenges are enjoyable, testing your knowledge of proper counters and  giving you a chance to learn the ins and outs of units and structures you don't  utilize in the campaign. Like every other mode, the learning curve of these  challenges is smooth, rewarding novices with lower-level achievements while  pushing experts to try for the top-tier rewards. You may lament the inability  to further practice with friends over a local area network, but fortunately,  the Battle.net interface functions smoothly, and players that cause extreme lag  can be removed from matches.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="515" height="356" src="game-content-img/vga_starcraft2_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2010/209/1547955-939643_20100729_023.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You'll want to return to some missions to earn the most challenging  achievements.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Starcraft  II was clearly built to run on all manner of PCs. Its system requirements are  relatively low, and even at the highest settings, noticeable aliasing and some  simple geometry keep it from setting a new bar for technical wizardry. Yet, it  sports a wonderful sci-fi look and is filled with little details that  constantly catch your eye, from buzzards scouring the dusty land to tiny  civilian robots flitting to and fro. The campaign features a lovely variety of  different environments, from tree-lined roadways stretching through green  meadows to the charred crust of once-populated worlds. Units move with absolute  fluidity, making the simple act of issuing orders a pleasure. Equally great  sound effects augment the pleasure. The clicks and gurgles of the Zerg are  appropriately repulsive, while the hums and buzzes of Protoss structures and  units are distinctive and satisfying.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  most dedicated of the dedicated will further contribute to Starcraft II's  longevity by using the included user creation tools to develop new maps, new  modifications, and even entirely different kinds of games. One such game--a  top-down shoot-'em-up--is already featured within the campaign to show off the  possibilities these tools bring to the table. These tools aren't as simple to  use as what you'd find in, say,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/little-big-planet-review/1900-6199348/"><span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Little Big Planet</span></a>, but there are already  a good number of custom maps and modes to download, and there are assuredly  many, many more on their way. But even without a burgeoning supply of  user-created content, Starcraft II would stand on its own as a true gem,  providing strategy veterans with a tournament-focused online package while  easing newcomers in with easier difficulty levels, offline challenges, and even  a friendly introduction to competitive play. The campaign's focus on the  Terrans and a few scattered inconveniences aren't great nuisances--not in an  RTS as outstanding as this one. Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty is not just an  old game with a pretty new face. It's a varied and full-featured jewel that  will keep you stuck to your computer chair for weeks, months, and even years to  come.</p>
