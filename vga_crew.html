    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The Crew tries to  be a driving game with something for everyone. You can team up with a group of  friends for an epic road trip filled with fast-paced illegal activities, and  seamlessly explore a massive map of the U.S., from the tip of Maine, all the  way down to Miami, over to Los Angeles and back again, passing through other  iconic cities along the way. Though it's true that all of this is possible, the  experience isn't all that it's made out to be. The Crew tries to do a lot, and  while it technically delivers the features it promises, it frequently stumbles  over itself. There are brief moments of joy within, but just when you start to  think the game's turned a corner, a bump in the road sends your joyride  careening off course. When the best thing a racing game has going for it is the  variety of environments it has to offer, you know something's amiss.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You start off in  the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through  mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of  activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go  and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a  trope-filled campaign that plays out like a&nbsp;<em>Fast &amp; Furious</em>&nbsp;sequel,  send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of  the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down  competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your  abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things  to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover,  The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from  the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking.  It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally out  dated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are  represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of  aliasing.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">At some point  during your journey across America, you wonder: what was that about forming a  crew, again? Despite the game's title and pitch, The Crew is a single-player  experience tucked into a multiplayer server. It starts with a story that casts  you on a grand mission, and you're constantly encouraged by your cohorts to  head to the next step along the way. You always have the option of inviting  three of your friends along for the ride, but at no point does the game inspire  you to do so. Think extra crewmates will help you on a difficult mission? Nope;  the game scales its difficulty accordingly. If anything, forming a crew is a  chore that's easy to brush aside. The best thing you can do to improve your  chances at success is to upgrade your car, but the way in which The Crew  facilitates this can get a little frustrating. While the game won't prevent you  from entering a story mission, it will tell you if you're below the recommended  level. You can purchase kits when you're avatar's level is high enough, but it  takes a while to hit successive milestones.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">In practice, you  earn new parts as rewards for missions, but playing story missions alone won't  provide you with enough parts to get your vehicle to the appropriate level  towards the end of the game. That's when you have to grind through optional  missions, which pop up as you drive around the map. Some of these objectives  are enjoyable, such as long-distance jumps and missions that challenge you to  drive as fast and as far as you can while keeping your tires on the road.  Others, like the missions that challenge you to hit a series of targets that  are strewn both on and off the road, are frustrating. Essentially, the game  asks you to drive like a jerk, and it's not fun when you can't help but careen  into other cars and buildings as you try your best to fulfill the criteria to  earn a medal. It comes down to the luck of the draw. Sometimes the coast is  clear, and other times you're bombarded by a phalanx of other vehicles that you  can't avoid when pursuing objectives.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; background:#F2F2F3; "> </span></p>
    <center><img src="game-content-img/tc1.jpg" width="602" height="335"></center>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These optional  missions can be useful when you need to level up, but they can also be an  annoyance when you're just trying to get from point A to point B. Every time  you hit the road, you eventually cross the virtual gate that activates these  missions, but there's nothing you can do to prevent them from activating  automatically. Pass through a gate, and you have to suffer through a cluttered  user interface, which starts with icons, but ends with a large results screen  that blocks your view while driving. Apart from driving off the road to avoid a  gate, or entering into a menu to abort after a mission activates, you're at the  mercy of the map.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">One of the best  aspects of a racing game is the selection of cars that you get to choose from,  but The Crew has a meager selection and does a poor job of incentivizing you to  explore your options. Story missions are broken up by the type of vehicle they  require: street, dirt, raid, performance, or circuit. Not every vehicle can be  kitted out to fit every spec, but the one you get at the start of the game  definitely can. Given that you earn new parts for the vehicle you complete  missions with, you are never compelled to pick up new cars. Maybe your  curiosity will get the better of you and you'll check out a new car, but there's  nothing stopping you from using the same car from the beginning of the game  through to the end.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Although the  variety of cars is underwhelming and underutilized, the story missions take  advantage of the different car specs in a good way. As you travel from one  region of the country to the next, you encounter different terrain and  environments that call upon the different types of kits you can fit to your  car. You race street cars through dense cities, take on dirt car races through  construction sites and rough terrain, and tear across states in souped up  performance vehicles. The story missions are largely the best moments in the  game, however, there exceptions: raid car missions and fleeing missions.</p>
    
    <center><img src="game-content-img/tc2.jpg" width="480" height="267"></center>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Raid missions are  fun at first--you charge through mountains, swamps, and back country in an  armored vehicle--but at some point, the game decides that you need to fulfill  precise criteria, such as collecting objects on rough terrain under a strict  time limit, and raid cars are anything but precise. They slip and slide all  over the place, and when these missions leave no room for error, you end up  very frustrated when you're cut short due to the game's poor physics. The same  can be said for missions where you have to flee from cops, who are incredibly  overpowered. These missions are not fun in the least, and the cops' unusual  bursts of speed feels like a product of driving games of old. This isn't the  only example of frustrating AI. During races against the computer, cars  sometimes drive off of tracks for no reason, taking a 90 degree turn out of the  blue before flying off of a cliff.</p>
    <center><img src="game-content-img/tc3.jpg" width="480" height="269"></center>
   
    
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">With rough physics and AI, you get into a lot of  collisions, but luckily, damage doesn't hinder your car's driving capabilities.  However, you do have to endure a slow-motion cutscene as punishment when you  take a strong hit. Eventually, you have to pay a negligible fee to fix your car  if you've gotten in a lot of accidents, but it's a drop in the bucket compared  to how much money you earn during missions. If crashing is not a big deal,  wasting players' time with slow-motion cutscenes as punishment is pointless and  disrespectful of their time.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Unfortunately, you have to endure the game's  questionable physics in other scenarios, most notably during  player-versus-player races. It's nearly a guarantee that each PVP race will  start with a ridiculous display of bugginess when opponents' cars suddenly  speed up and flip in multiple directions at the drop of a hat. I've seen cars  teleport into the sky, and rotate uncontrollably before appearing 20 feet down  the track for no reason. These moments of chaos are funny, but they make for an  inconsistent and unpredictable experience. Pray it doesn't happen to you.  That's assuming you can even get into a PVP match. There are a handful of lobbies  across the map, but they're severely underpopulated. It's a rare occurrence  that you can find enough people to race against in less than 15 minutes.  Luckily, you have the option to drive around while you wait, but it's still  deflating when you can't find anyone to play with.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Keep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is  down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time  with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily  basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's  connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have  issues.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">When The Crew puts you into races with good AI, and  you get to race through interesting and varied environments, you get the  feeling that you're playing a good game. When you struggle to find people to  join your crew online, balk at the outdated graphics, and shake your head at  the AI and the occasionally unpredictable physics, you realize: The Crew isn't  that good after all. When you can't play due to server issues, you find a new  game to play and leave The Crew in your dust.</p>
