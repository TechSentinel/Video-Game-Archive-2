    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&quot;Damage  critical.&quot; The words appear on the screen in red, sending a rush through  me. One more hit and I'm done for. It's too far to the nearest repair shop; I  know I need to make it back to a hideout fast or I'll lose everything. I gun  it, relying on my reflexes to help me evade the police, with their spike strips  and their reckless attempts to run me off the road. There are only two possible  outcomes: the triumph of big risks taken and big rewards achieved, or the agony  of seeing everything I've earned slip away in an instant. Which will it be this  time?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Despite being the  work of new developer Ghost Games, Need for Speed: Rivals is clearly a game in  the mold of Criterion's entries in the Need for Speed series, particularly  2010's excellent&nbsp;Hot Pursuit. In this game, as in that one, you step into  the cars of both cops and racers and cruise around a gorgeous open world,  completing events that require you to either evade the law or enforce it. Of  course, enforcing the law here isn't a matter of asking drivers to politely  pull over; instead, it involves ramming racers at speed, using spike strips and  shock rams, and wrecking the elusive racers' vehicles by any means necessary.  As a racer, you have plenty of tricks up your sleeve as well, including shock  waves that damage and repel nearby vehicles, and jammers that prevent the cops  or your fellow racers from using their own weapons against you.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="background:#F2F2F3; "><img width="601" height="339" src="game-content-img/vga_nfsr_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/78/787590/2379026-ci-139348273630335390.jpg"></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This wild technology can get you out of a tight  spot as a racer or help you incapacitate one as a cop, but it's your skills as  a driver that matter most. Weaving through traffic and around roadblocks,  drifting smoothly around turns, and making smart use of your limited nitrous  can make all the difference, and dividing your attention between driving  skilfully and making the most of your tech is wonderfully stimulating. With so  much going on at once, it's not unusual to feel like you're operating on pure  instinct, and when you get into that zone, Need for Speed: Rivals is aggressive  arcade racing bliss. These cars feel hefty and substantial, so as you side-slam  a cop or hit a racer from the rear, you can almost feel the clash of metal on  metal in your bones.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Most of this could have been said about Need for  Speed: Hot Pursuit too. And the event types that are scattered around the  landscape are standard stuff: straightforward races, time trials, hot pursuits  in which cops try to bust racers before they reach the finish line, and so on.  But there are two things that reinvigorate this familiar gameplay in Rivals.  One of those is that, by default, you always share the world with other  players. Those players might be cops or they might be racers, and as you cruise  around trying to complete objectives to advance your own career, your  experiences and the experiences of these other players might collide. If you're  playing as a racer, for instance, someone playing as a cop might start pursuing  you, whether you're in the middle of an event or you're just cruising around.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_nfsr_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/78/787590/2379032-ci-212302273630335390.jpg">.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">And if you're a cop, hunting a human player across  the winding roads of Redview County--an environment that offers no shortage of  obstructions you can smash through and shortcuts that you can take advantage  of--is more exhilarating than pursuing artificially intelligent prey. Other  games in the series have had multiplayer options that pit cops against racers,  but here, the multiplayer is seamlessly integrated into the world at large. You  can encounter other players at any time, and as a result, the world feels alive  in a way that earlier games in the series haven't. If you choose not to share a  world with other players, AI cops and racers roam the roads, so there's still a  chance you'll run right into a high-speed chase or some other action even when  you're playing alone.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The seamlessness with which events are integrated into  the world does carry with it the occasional downside. If you start a race, for  instance, while being pursued by cops, the cops might crowd around you during  the few seconds before the race starts, during which you're immobile. Once the  race begins, you're hindered by the cluster of cop cars surrounding you, while  your opponents speed off unhindered. Your opponents slow down significantly if  you fall behind early, though, giving you a conspicuously artificial  opportunity to catch up. And it's frustrating that, while you're being pursued  as a racer, you can't use the GPS function to set a waypoint for the event of  your choice.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The other element that makes Rivals particularly  exciting is the irresistible risk-versus-reward mechanic you're constantly  faced with as a racer. As you roam the roads, completing events and escaping  the cops, you build up a score multiplier, and eventually, you're racking up  the speed points you need to purchase new cars and upgrade existing ones really  quickly. But your heat level also increases, meaning that the cops become  increasingly aggressive in their efforts to hunt you down. It becomes extremely  tempting to press your luck, to take one more risk, complete one more event,  and reap the rewards. But if you're busted--which can happen anywhere at any  time, until you make it back to a hideout--you lose all of the speed points  you've accrued on that outing. It's deliciously excruciating to see all your  points slip away, and narrowly escaping the law to make it back to a hideout with  a fat stack of points makes you feel like the king of the road.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="background:#F2F2F3; "><img width="601" height="339" src="game-content-img/vga_nfsr_clip_image005.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/78/787590/2379030-ci-10694544030335389.jpg"></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">And what a beautiful road it is. There's nothing  decidedly next-gen about the look of Rivals, but it's still a gorgeous game.  Redview County is lush and inviting, with leaves blowing in the forest winds,  waves crashing on the coast, and pleasure seekers hang-gliding in the clear  blue skies. At least until the weather changes. At that point, a thunderstorm  might lend an ominous atmosphere to a dangerous race along a cliffside.  Whatever the forecast, the cars themselves, and the collisions they tend to get  into, look spectacular, sending showers of metal and glass in all directions.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Need for Speed: Rivals is very much in the  tradition of Hot Pursuit, but that great, familiar gameplay has been infused  with enough new elements to make it as thrilling here as it's ever been. It  sure is good to hit the open road again.</p>
