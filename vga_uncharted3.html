    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">Is it  possible to have your expectations raised too high?&nbsp;Uncharted 2: Among  Thieves&nbsp;delivered a monumental leap over the first game in the series, and  it might be easy to fall into the trap of assuming the same advancements would  take place in every subsequent release. If that's your state of mind going into  Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, you might walk away slightly disappointed. But  that's not a fair response. Though the third entry in this treasure-hunting  franchise offers a similar experience to its revered predecessor, it's no less  magical. Just about every element showcases the care and craftsmanship you  would expect from the series. Combat is even more versatile than in previous  entries, combining incredible shooting encounters with advanced hand-to-hand  takedowns set in lavishly designed areas. When you need a break from the taxing  physical endeavors, thoughtful puzzles allow you to explore your more  contemplative side. And these two elements are punctuated by exhilarating  set-piece events that leave you gasping. Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is  another superb entry in Nathan Drake's ongoing quest to find the world's many  lost treasures.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">Once again,  Nathan Drake is in search of lost treasure in a mysterious land. The story  encompasses many of the same tropes from previous games--deception, twists,  camaraderie--though the nuts and bolts of the plot have never been one of  Uncharted's strong points. Rather, it's the realistic portrayal of  characters--their lively back-and-forth discussions and snide jokes--that give  you a reason to care about the tale. Drake, Sully, and the supporting cast  sport detailed animation that makes them almost look real, and their playful  dialogue further cements this image. Tempers flare, threats are made, and you  can feel the tension during heated moments. But these lifelong friends always  make up, and it's their believable relationships that make it so easy to become  invested in their struggles.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">When you  picture Uncharted, you may think of plundering ancient tombs or throwing as  many grenades as you can manage in bombastic sequences. But the opening of  Drake's Deception eschews the larger-than-life action the series is known for  in favor of an old-fashioned bar brawl. This is where the new animations that  have been incorporated into fisticuffs are apparent as you wrestle with a  platoon of aggressive men in a confined place. Shoving a burly dude into the  bar while you pummel his face or grabbing a stray bottle to crash over  someone's head conjures images of Patrick Swayze handling business in&nbsp;<em>Road  House</em>, and the controls are precise enough to make it possible to manage an  approaching group without getting your face beaten. Ultimately, these instances  where you're forced to take matters into your own hands are the weakest aspect  of the game because your freedom is so limited, but that's not to say they're  boring. There's a satisfying rhythm to throwing fists while avoiding counters,  and you have enough flexibility to move around that you don't feel like you're  just performing.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; color:white; "><img width="621" height="307" src="game-content-img/vga_uncharted3_clip_image002_0002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/296/reviews/1810699-615426_20111024_001.jpg"></span><span style="color:white; "> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; color:white; ">As much fun as it may be to bash in a  man's head with a wooden chair, it can't match the thrill of beating a man with  your fists when he's sporting an assault rifle. There are segments where you  have to fistfight in Drake's Deception, but there are other times when you're  in a battle for your life and you can use any weapon you want to stay alive.  Thanks to the incredibly impactful animations of a hand-to-hand assault, it's  fun to put aside the bullets and explosives to focus on getting your hands  dirty instead. Being sneaky certainly helps. Snapping a man's neck before he  can turn around or just shoving someone clear off a building is immensely  rewarding. But there are other times when stealth doesn't work, and you find  yourself grappling, feinting, and punching below the belt, while bullets fly  and enemies scream death threats at you. Particular animations make these  encounters a special treat. You may grasp the barrel of your gun and swing at  someone's head with a metal uppercut or elbow a foe in the neck like a wrestler  suffering from roid rage, and it's hard to contain your joyous laugh. There are  times when you run out of bullets and fighting with your fists is the only way  to go. Once you finish off your foe, a slow motion moment in which Drake  snatches your enemy's discarded gun in midair adds a fitting end to the fight.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; color:white; ">Of course, you don't have to go  toe-to-toe if you'd rather not. The beauty of Uncharted's combat is that you  can dispatch foes in a variety of ways, and all of them feel incredibly  empowering. The key is the expertly designed levels. Drake's Deception is a  cover-based, third-person shooter; thus, chest-high walls populate many of your  encounters. But those familiar structures aren't used as a crutch here.  Verticality gives you the option to climb around like a gun-toting monkey if  you prefer, getting the drop on lackadaisical foes. If a man with a rocket  launcher is forcing you</span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; color:white; "> </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; color:white; ">to hunker behind a piece of debris,  fear not; you can smoothly leap from cover, shimmy up a nearby wall, and sprint  pell-mell across a rooftop. Grab a sniper rifle on the way if you want to  handle him from afar or a shotgun if you'd like to pop him right in the head.  Toss grenades at the group of enemies hiding by that well, man the turret once  you finish</span><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'; color:white; "> </span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; color:white; ">off its previous operator, or sprint  past everyone until you make it to the door that marks your safety. Versatile  level design lets you choose how to go about killing your pesky foes in Drake's  Deception, and rock-solid controls ensure every action you want to perform can  be pulled off without any hesitation.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; color:white; "><img width="578" height="280" src="game-content-img/vga_uncharted3_clip_image004_0002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/296/reviews/1810700-615426_20111024_002.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; color:white; "> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; color:white; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">Nathan found  the perfect hiding place: right in a spotlight.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">If you're  feeling sluggish and just want to use your gun for a while, doing so is a  perfectly valid alternative to the high-flying adventuring. The mechanics in  Drake's Deception have been refined even further from the previous game. No  matter which gun you grab, you can target weak points with ease, and enemies  recoil when you prick their flesh with searing-hot bullets. Drake's Deception  offers so many different ways to take down foes that you might think it falls into  the camp of jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But that's not true at all. If  you take things slowly--crouch behind cover only risking your neck when the  opportunity presents itself--you have just as much of a chance to succeed as  someone who makes use of Drake's agility. And you can have just as much fun,  too. The weapons are a blast to use. Landing a headshot from across the map  with a sniper rifle is eminently satisfying, as is taking out a gunner with a  sure blast from a shotgun. You can easily keep an enemy off balance with a  fast-shooting assault rifle or knock a grenade right out of someone's hand with  a steady pistol. Ample ammunition lets you focus on the fun of firing rather  than scrounging for extra bullets, so you can stick with your favorite weapon  if you want or mix things up after every fight.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="color:white; ">Uncharted is  at its best when the difficulty rises. During many of the game's fights, you  can relax and dispose of foes with easy grace. Though this is certainly fun,  being forced to play smartly makes things even more exciting. Enemies aren't  scared to charge at you when you're hiding behind cover. When you see someone  sprinting in your direction, you have to decide quickly if you're going to run  or fight, and that decision is frequently the difference between life and  death. Dealing with flanking enemies while a sniper is keeping you pinned down  forces you to act with determination, and though you may die repeatedly in  certain sections, it rarely feels like the game is at fault. However, not every  aspect of the combat is flawless. There are times when the AI forgets you're  trying to kill them and they just stand around, taking in the impressive view.  On the other end of the spectrum, your location may be uncovered when you're  trying to be sneaky, even if you stay out of sight. There's also a small quirk  with the hand-to-hand killing animations. One of these involves pulling the pin  from an enemy's grenade. This looks painfully delightful, but if this randomly  triggered event happens at the wrong time, you could be stuck with nowhere to  flee.</span></p>
