    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">While the meat of the action takes  the form of brutally demanding encounters with the human and less-than-human  threats inhabiting the no man&rsquo;s land outside of America&rsquo;s fortified cities,  that&rsquo;s literally and figuratively only half the story. The Last of Us is billed  as &quot;survival action,&quot; and the ceaseless realisation of the former  concept makes every second of the game a thrilling, emotionally pounding and  intellectually nourishing experience.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Built around a solid stealth system  driven by line-of-sight, The Last of Us&rsquo; action encourages an entirely  player-driven approach to almost every encounter. Provided he can scavenge the  gear needed to build and feed them, Joel has a healthy array of potential tools  at his disposal, ranging from firearms to Molotov cocktails and nail-bombs. The  most powerful weapons he has though, are thought and tactical adaptation. And  that makes every encounter in the game fresh, exciting, terrifying and  deliciously unpredictable.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Wide, sprawling, multi-leveled  environments encourage and reward creative play at every turn. All of Joel&rsquo;s  tools have great versatility, able to be used directly or more cleverly for  misdirection. While not really a traditional stealth game, direct  confrontations, even with the rarity of a fully loaded gun in hand, are unwise.  Emphasising the worn-out, desperate state of the world, ammo is in painfully  short supply, even from enemy drops. With no fancy silenced weapons available,  firing even a single shot is akin to sending up a flare inviting enemies to Joel&rsquo;s  location. Instead, it&rsquo;s best--and far more satisfying--to play cat-and-mouse  with the sophisticated AI, using its knowledge of your last location to herd it  around and manipulate its behaviour, hanging on by your fingernails to stay  just one step ahead and maintain an advantage. It&rsquo;s as exciting to the brain as  it is to the adrenal gland.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The items that fuel the crafting  system require studious searching of the environment to acquire. And even when  you have the bits, crafting takes real, in-game time. As does using the manual  healing system, assuming you&rsquo;ve made enough health kits. Go into a fight  unprepared, and finding a safe place to resupply becomes a life-or-death  challenge in itself.</span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The Last of Us Remastered improves an already excellent game? Here are the  differences you can expect to find in the PS4 release.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">That&rsquo;s the wonderful thing. This  isn&rsquo;t a set of separate, isolated elements. It&rsquo;s made up of a whole stack of  disciplines and possibilities, working together organically to create a deep,  layered, ever-changing, and constantly stimulating whole. Options are always  open, every move has an equal risk and reward, and with no rules or penalties  governing your approach, any decision that keeps you alive is the right  decision. But with Ellie by Joel&rsquo;s side throughout, each choice comes loaded  with a weighty sense of responsibility.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">But as stated, that&rsquo;s only half of  the story. Because part of the reason The Last of Us&rsquo; violent encounters remain  so tooth-rattlingly affecting is how sporadically placed they are throughout  the game. The resonance of the (necessarily) brutal violence never dissipates  through over-repetition, but more so, the slow-burning nature of the game&rsquo;s  pacing infuses every encounter with immense emotional weight.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">This is a game of extended, ambient  travel sequences and powerfully underplayed character development. The vast,  gorgeously decaying vistas of a world reclaimed by nature are a constant  reminder of both the weight of Joel and Ellie&rsquo;s quest and the necessity of  vigilance and violence at all times. They&rsquo;re also a source of visual wonder,  bringing out joy and confusion in Ellie while reminding Joel of a better past.  In these quieter sections, be they meandering environmental puzzles in which  Joel finds ways for the less capable Ellie to progress, or simply lengthy treks  through the urban wilderness of a society long-since collapsed, the immense  quality of the game&rsquo;s writing and performances really shines.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="516" height="286" src="game-content-img/vga_lou_clip_image004_0001.jpg" alt="http://3ebd2a0c0ea48a333aea-1f531def8e8befb67be56667ce3edd11.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/99f5c753f765e62f0a311a6550e9eb38703e17b8.png__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">The slow exploration of an  abandoned town might spark up equal excitement and sadness in Ellie as she  discovers the long-dead remains of a world she never got to know. Her playful  instinct might take over as she explores an abandoned neighbourhood while Joel  hunts for supplies. And the game&rsquo;s narratively minded treatment of even mundane  tasks ensures that the frequent scavenging never becomes tedious busywork.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Apparently empty areas are often  the ones most packed with content. Not much might seem to happen while  exploring a deserted plaza for gear, but these are the times that ambient,  environmental storytelling will most frequently trigger quietly significant  exchanges between the two leads.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">As such, the high stakes, low  resources and knowledge that anything could be around the next corner feed  directly into the importance of each and every trinket found. You only survive  by what you bring to the equation, giving every life-saving bomb or trap a  personal significance. Particularly if the parts used to build it came from the  hands of a dead family making a similar survival bid to Joel and Ellie&rsquo;s. There  might be a great deal of downtime between the action, but the game never rests.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="534" height="295" src="game-content-img/vga_lou_clip_image006_0001.jpg" alt="http://3ebd2a0c0ea48a333aea-1f531def8e8befb67be56667ce3edd11.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/b1ee1c31800b7e59d045f20fe2f0a9b746e065fe.png__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">It&rsquo;s the interplay during minute,  delicately sketched events like these that brings about the many subtle  interactions through which the characters&rsquo; personalities and viewpoints gently  rub off on each other, gradually but completely transforming the two and their  relationship. Ellie&rsquo;s curiosity at a world Joel is trying to forget slowly  forces him to modify his outlook and actions, while his weary, coldly logical  demeanour starts to inform Ellie&rsquo;s approach.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">And  all of this feeds straight back into both gameplay and tone: Ellie&rsquo;s hardening  makes her an increasingly useful combat aid, while also raising uncomfortable  questions about what she might be turning into--questions you&rsquo;ll be forced to  address every time she bricks an enemy in the head to help you stay alive. It&rsquo;s  a violent game, but also sometimes a game&nbsp;<em><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; ">about</span></em>&nbsp;violence,  and that&rsquo;s a rare and worthy achievement indeed.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="544" height="302" src="game-content-img/vga_lou_clip_image008_0001.jpg" alt="http://3ebd2a0c0ea48a333aea-1f531def8e8befb67be56667ce3edd11.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/db60c3812c43707a6ce5000463fc0fa856316125.png__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Yes, The Last Of Us does have a  competitive online component, and it&rsquo;s far from the hastily cobbled together  addition some might expect. Rather, Factions mode proves itself to be  surprisingly adept at crafting thoughtful team deathmatches.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Split into two modes (Supply Raid  and Survivors) two teams of four players are pitted against each other with a  finite number of lives. In the former, each side has 20 lives rationed out  between its members; the first team to wittle the other&rsquo;s number down to zero  are declared the winners. Survivors goes one further and completely does away  with respawns all together over desperately tense three minute rounds.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Compliments to Naughty Dog for  creating a multiplayer that defies convention and focuses on slow-burning  strategy. The emphasis is very much on survival first, reckless killing a  distant second. In that sense, Factions captures the ideology of single-player  beautifully, even if it is unlikely to capture the COD crowd. If you're  planning on jumping back into multiplayer in the PS4's Remastered version of  the game, be aware that your PS3 progress won't carry over.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "><img width="598" height="331" src="game-content-img/vga_lou_clip_image009_0001.jpg" alt="http://3ebd2a0c0ea48a333aea-1f531def8e8befb67be56667ce3edd11.r77.cf1.rackcdn.com/2194f085fa6e7417fb83fc32f56d1f2dd6b9b495.png__620x348_q85_crop_upscale.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Built of a culmination of  everything that action gaming has grown to become over the last eight years,  The Last of Us is the definitive statement on what the genre has achieved thus  far. Made of wildly eclectic gameplay mechanics polished to a sheen, bound  intelligently and movingly to one of the most affecting narratives in games,  The Last of Us succeeds where so many pretenders have failed.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">It combines DNA strands from across  the genre, yet reworks and recontextualises them to become far more than the  sum of its parts. Its storytelling is peerless, as affecting and multi-layered  as it is grounded, underplayed and real. In terms of everything the modern  action game has strived to be, The Last of Us is the full-stop at the end of  the sentence, leaving no more to be said. Until next-gen. If this is our  starting point for that, then the next five to ten years could be truly  amazing.</span></p>
