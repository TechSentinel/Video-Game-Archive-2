    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  province of Skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place  within it burns with a fire few games possess. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,  you take up arms against dragons, and your encounters with them are invariably  exciting--yet depending on where your adventure takes you, such battles may not  even represent the pinnacle of your experience. A side quest that starts as a  momentary distraction may turn into a full-fledged tale that could form the  entirety of a less ambitious game. Yes, Skyrim is another enormous fantasy RPG  from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of  hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be  found within. If you know Bethesda Softworks' previous games, you might be  unsurprised that Skyrim is not a land without blemish, but rather harbors any  number of technical glitches and frustrating idiosyncrasies that tear open the  icy veil that blankets the land. Many of them are ones Elder Scrolls fans will  probably see coming, but they're ultimately a low price to pay for the wonders  of a game this sprawling and enthralling. Prepare for many sleepless nights to  come.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Those  nights traversing these lands are ones well spent. The game returns you to the  continent of Tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called Skyrim, home  to the Nord race. In these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and  platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. Nighttime often brings Tamriel's  version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons  stretching across the heavens. Skyrim's predecessor,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/"><span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Oblivion</span></a>, featured prototypical fantasy  environments--pretty but not quite evocative of the lore's darker undercurrents.  Skyrim embraces its darker elements. You might feel an eerie chill as you  glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life  before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. Skyrim's atmospheric tone  harks back to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</span></a>, only  the hazy dust storms of the earlier game have been replaced by glimmering  snowfall and opaque fog.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">These  lovely vistas are best seen from a distance. Closer inspection reveals hard edges,  plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should  you seek them out. But like many enormous games, Skyrim makes a fantastic  impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because  they contribute to a grander whole. There's so much to do that your quest log  becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given  time, each one as enticing as the next. You could follow the story, of course,  which weaves a compelling tale that casts you as a dragonborn; that is, the  soul of a dragon emanates from within you. As such, you are the key to  discovering why dragons have returned to the land, terrorizing cities and  potentially ending the known world. The tale has you facing dragons, of course,  but also crashing fancy dress parties and scouring sewers in search of a key  figure long assumed dead. It's a well-crafted tale that makes good use of those  fearsome flying creatures that horrify the masses with roaring gusts of fire  and ice.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="471" height="265" src="game-content-img/vga_ess_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/312/reviews/1820191-615805_20111009_001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Galloping through a winter wonderland.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Even  when you aren't pursuing story quests, though, the core narrative dogs you as  you trot across the land on foot or on horseback. You might travel to a quaint  hamlet only to discover that it's under siege by a hovering beast. The  townspeople join you, aiming their arrows and fireballs upward, and not all of  them may survive the encounter. These battles impress upon you the terror in  which the populace lives, and thus give you a reason to be a hero to them. But  plenty of narrative delights have nothing to do with dragons, and some of them  could have formed the main story of a lesser RPG. Following an early lead takes  you to a lonely house occupied by a single child with a disturbing request. The  story that unravels has you acting as a predator and eavesdropping from an  unimaginably sinister hiding place. Other story threads embrace the element of  choice. You can take sides in the ongoing conflict between Imperial forces and  the rebellious Stormcloaks, and then assault enemy camps and rescue prisoners  jailed by the enemy. And in one memorable if minor quest line, you can kill a  creepy cannibal--or join her and her cohorts at the table.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's  impressive enough that there's so much to do; it's even more impressive that  most of it is wonderful. Not every dungeon is a joy to explore. Stone-turning  puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs  could dampen your spirits. But overall, every task has an excellent sense of  context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. Searching for a lost dog turns  into a grander quest than you could have guessed--and witty writing and voice  acting shine some light into this somber world. Even a simple &quot;go there,  kill that&quot; bounty can be a thrill. After all, how often do you face a  towering giant and a couple of woolly mammoths? It's too bad that as you  approach the giant's camp, one of those mammoths might spawn 100 feet in the  air and fall to its death, or land on another mammoth and ride on its back for  a few seconds before sliding off.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="471" height="265" src="game-content-img/vga_ess_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/312/reviews/1820192-615805_20111009_002.jpg">U</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">lfric asks you to choose an ally. How will you decide?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">So  maybe not every surprise is a welcome one. But most are, and the element of the  unexpected is what lures you to explore as much as you can. The reward could be  a great weapon hidden in a locked chest, a gorgeous vista to ogle, or a book of  lore that enhances one of your attributes. Or perhaps you'll discover words  written in the dragons' tongue--an important discovery indeed. Finding those  words is key to using Skyrim's most powerful spells, known as shouts. Well,  they are half the key anyway: you also must defeat dragons and absorb their  souls to activate those shouts. Shouts have their own cooldown timer and aren't  tied to the magicka bar that governs standard spellcasting. With one shout, you  can breathe fire on your attackers. With another, you can slow down time.  Shouts hardly guarantee success in a difficult battle, but they can tip the  scales in your favor. Besides, the dramatic visual and sound effects of both  the discovery of words and the absorption of a dragon soul are a lovely bonus.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">As for  standard spells, they come in the usual schools of magicka: destruction (zap  skeletons with sparks!), conjuration (summon a giant frost atronach!),  alteration (light the way ahead!), and so on. You can even dual-wield spells,  going full-on mage, with a glowing ball of fire in one hand and a summon at the  ready in the other. For that matter, you can dual-wield one-handed weapons,  giving you more flexibility in how you form your character. When you create  your character, you choose a race from the usual Elder Scrolls standbys (Dark  Elf, Breton, Argonian, and so forth), but you don't choose a class. Rather,  your skill level with certain types of weapons, magicka schools, speech, and so  on is governed primarily by how you play. Wear heavy armor, and taking blows  gradually increases your heavy armor proficiency. Swing two-handed weapons, and  you get better at using them.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">That  doesn't mean that you don't wield manual control over how you progress. Each  time you gain a level, you choose to enhance one of your three main attributes:  health, stamina, or magicka. You also earn a single point to spend on a perk,  which might increase damage done with axes or let you conjure creatures at a  greater distance. It's a great leveling system that forms around the way you  play, but allows for tweaking so that you retain a sense of control. Even just  the act of leveling up can be a pleasure due to the slick and colorful  interface that imagines perks as stars in constellations. It can be a pain to  navigate to certain perks; the game often has you flitting not to the star you  want, but to all the ones surrounding it. But considering Oblivion's cumbersome  interface, Skyrim's is a much improved beast. On console (and if you play with  a controller on the PC), thumbstick navigation minimizes button presses, and  you can easily move between your quest log and the main map. Additionally, you  can mark weapons, spells, and items as favorites and then access them quickly during  combat. Certain aspects might be fiddly, but on the whole, Skyrim's interface  is a wonder, considering how much information and inventory is at your  fingertips.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Regardless  of how you tailor your character, the action is entertaining and varied.  Trolls, undead draugrs, necromancers, bandits, witches, ratlike skeevers, and  many more foes want to make your hero a zero. You occasionally feel as if  you're flailing blindly rather than connecting your sharp blade with a  vampire's flesh. But this is the tightest Elder Scrolls combat yet, the visual  and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.  Some death blows result in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/"><span style="color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Fallout 3</span></a>-style slow-motion  kills, which retain their power because they're not overly frequent. Movement,  too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel  like you're moving across the land instead of floating above it. What hasn't  been improved is the friendly AI. It's nice to have a companion along for the  adventure, and you're given one for free early in the story. But companions are  morons, crowding you in tight passages, lagging behind when you need them the  most, and even getting stuck in various death loops caused by spinning blade  traps.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If you're  the stealthy type, you can sneak about, picking pockets and breaking into  homes. If you really enjoy keeping to the shadows, you may even wish to  contract porphyric hemophilia--that is, vampirism. Vampires earn some benefits  by way of certain spells and status effects, but also endure particular risks  and must feed on unsuspecting victims as they slumber. But even if you like to  wade directly into the fray, you can benefit from Skyrim's non-combat  activities. Lock-picking no longer works as it did in Oblivion, but takes its  cue from Fallout 3, having you rotate a lock pick and turn the lock to  determine how closely you matched the correct position. As before, you can pick  flowers and collect ingredients, and then create potions out of them at an alchemy  table. (Forget mortars and pestles this time around.) And any adventurer can  benefit from enchanting, which lets you imbue your equipment with certain  status effects--though you must use soul gems to recharge their power.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="479" height="269" src="game-content-img/vga_ess_clip_image006.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/312/reviews/1820193-615805_20111009_003.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Third-person view is much more functional than in previous Elder Scrolls  games.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Many  of Skyrim's delights are the touches that occur outside of the action. Citizens  go about their daily lives, selling their wares in shops during the day and  closing down at night to hang out in the pub or head home to rest. Under some  circumstances, they may comment on your rancid breath or remark on how sickly  you seem to look. Children run up and down the streets; one may even ask for  you to stop a bully from picking on him. Citizens move somewhat stiffly, but  with more grace than in previous Elder Scrolls games. Before, conversations  brought the world to a halt and focused the camera on some character's waxy  face. In Skyrim, certain dialogues limit the camera and temporarily paralyze  you in place, but overall, conversations feel more organic than before--a nice  improvement that enhances your sense of immersion.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Skyrim  also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. You may not be a big  fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an  effort here. If you don't feel like reading up on Tamriel's rich history each  time you find a volume, grab it and read it later--there are a lot of narrative  tidbits that deserve to be read. Elder Scrolls fans will appreciate nods to events  in prior games, and everyone can enjoy the bite-size tales contained therein,  about vampires, noble heroes, and gods that bestow their blessings on their  followers. Skyrim takes place hundreds of years after the events of Oblivion,  and organizations you might remember have been restructured or are shadows of  their former selves. But Tamriel's history is threaded throughout Skyrim's  fabric, and some quests, such as one that begins with an invitation to a  faraway museum, are great reminders of past misfortunes that the world has not  forgotten.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="533" height="300" src="game-content-img/vga_ess_clip_image008.jpg" alt="Description: http://static3.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/gamespot/images/2011/312/reviews/1820194-615805_20111009_004.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Final kill animation or big sloppy lupine kiss? You be the judge.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's a  pity that Skyrim often breaks the immersion it tries so hard to create, in ways  both minor and major. Some bizarre details are simply annoying. A character  might initiate conversation through the ceiling. The chatter of nearby  characters could drown out important story exposition. Two shopkeepers standing  next to each other may be voiced by the same actor and repeat the same lines. A  dragon skeleton might disappear and then later drop out of the sky in a new  location. A dragon could get stuck in place, flailing about in the geometry in  a mess of wings and tail. For that matter,&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;could get stuck  in the environment, maybe just by walking into a corner, which forces you to  either quick-travel to a different location (if you're lucky enough to be  outdoors) or load a save game. The game runs elegantly at highest settings on a  properly equipped PC, though you could experience a crash to desktop or two.  The question isn't whether you will experience anomalies--it's a given. The  question is: which ones and how many?</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">If  you've played previous Elder Scrolls games, glitches and oddities don't come as  a surprise. Nevertheless, Skyrim comes in a year graced with multiple quality  RPGs that feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, better animations, and so forth.  But to be fair, none of those games are endowed with such enormity. Yet The  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim doesn't rely on sheer scope to earn its stripes. It isn't  just that there's a lot to do: it's that most of it is so good. Whether you're  slashing a dragon's wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at  the alchemy table, Skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the  one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it.</p>
