    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">There is a quiet, almost imperceptible genius  to&nbsp;PES 2016&nbsp;that will leave players struggling to explain exactly why  they have fallen in love with it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">This finely crafted soccer sim will be lauded by  fans who, almost certainly, will base their judgements around the word  &quot;feel&quot;. As in, doing almost everything in PES 2016&nbsp;<em>feels&nbsp;</em>fantastic,  from fearless and desperate sliding tackles, to holding up the ball under  pressure, to the heavenly wave of pride that comes with outthinking and turning  a defender.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Such ethereal joys make PES 2016 wonderful in ways  that its peers and predecessors are not. How developer PES Productions has  delivered on this, however, is tricky to discern. Great design is transparent,  goes the saying, and 2016's triumph does not come from a standout feature that  can be snappily summarised on the back of the box. It's not your old smartphone  but now with a fingerprint scanner. It's not Malibu Stacy with a new hat.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">PES 2016 sings in your hands for more elaborate  reasons, namely how it wonderfully converges two rather sexless elements:  Physics and AI. The advances made in these fundamentals have achieved a more  physical, smarter, strategic soccer sim for both football nerds and casual fans  alike. It's more fluid, fluctuant, and alive than ever.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Above all else, the most meaningful stride forward  is the new collision system, which so much now hinges on. Considering that  soccer games live and die by their authenticity, and that dynamic physics  systems almost inevitably throw up&nbsp;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/dlpbf.gif"><span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">gif-worthy  calamities</span></a>, you have to commend the audacity of PES Productions for betting the  whole farm on its new tech. What's quite remarkable is how faultless it has  turned out to be, free from comical miscalculations and distorted momentum  swings.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="599" height="374" src="game-content-img/vga_pes16_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2936906-pes-2016-master-league-main-menu-1.jpg"></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The Master League redesign adds in a calendar and  news headlines, and the overall presentation will seem familiar to Football  Manager fans.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Flaccid terms like &quot;collision system&quot; may  not ignite the hype, but the tech is a godsend. It brings new life to  challenges for possession; no longer are they binary exchanges where either a  tackle works or doesn't. Here, fights for the ball are more organic,  unpredictable, combative affairs. PES 2016 doesn't rely on canned animations of  players giving up and falling over; instead players barge back, protect the  ball, and scramble for balance when their shins are clipped. You have more  control over your fate, and no longer do you feel anxious to pass the ball away  when under pressure. Players can protect themselves, wait for options to  unfold, and if fleet-footed enough, can dance out of trouble.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Those challenging for possession will prod and  push, but reaching the ball does not equal automatic success. The player  collision meshes are water-tight, which, combined with the brainpower of the  physics system, means that erratic sliding tackles can result in tangled legs  and the ball bobbling away. Meanwhile, the tech also gives smaller players the  chance to disrupt towering centre-forwards as they jostle to connect with an  oncoming cross. Ultimately it means that timing and canniness has become just  as important as ferocity and speed, giving PES 2016 an excellent feel (that  word again) of realism and fluidity. PES 2015's aggravating pass delay issue,  meanwhile, has been fully resolved.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The outcome of such  improvements might be considered a key moment for Konami's dethroned soccer  series.

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The outcome of such improvements might be  considered a key moment for Konami's dethroned soccer series. PES 2016  proclaims that no longer do you have to play games of tactless scuffles for  possession in search of that Hollywood goal. No longer should you settle for a  robotic and clunky back-and-forth for control whilst you pray for that  scintillating breakthrough. This is a game that converts the minute-by-minute  battles for possession into micro-sized wars of glory and anguish. PES 2016  wants you to have fun between the highlights. This is a game that revels in its  own scrappiness, with passes pinging wayward from the outstretched leg of a  indomitable defender, with shots deflecting off shins and knees and into the  opposite path of where the keeper was diving.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">d goal. No longer should you settle for a robotic  and clunky back-and-forth for control whilst you pray for that scintillating  breakthrough.

This is a game that revels in its own  scrappiness, with passes pinging wayward from the outstretched leg of a  indomitable defender, with shots deflecting off shins and knees and into the  opposite path of where the keeper was diving.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's not perfect. In the transition to the new  physics system, it appears that PES is not quite sure what a foul is. Any  tackle is deemed fair game providing the ball is touched, and while that is an  understandable baseline rule, in practice even the most perverse and dangerous  sliding tackles are unpunished. One suspects the officials would allow E.  Honda's Hundred-Hand Slap as long as he flicked the ball in the process.  Meanwhile, assaulting a random player, accidentally or not, sometimes isn't  even deemed a foul. There is a reasonable argument to be had in Konami's  defence, in that the flow of a game shouldn't be disrupted by silly and  inconsequential fingerslips, but nevertheless it breaks the illusion.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="598" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_pes16_clip_image004_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1544/15443861/2936908-http---pthumbnails.5min.com-10380083-519004138_3_o.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">As ever, PES 2016 misses out on official licenses.  Yet its community will rejoice at the editor on PS4 and Xbox One</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">But this is the only negative trade-off that comes  with switching to a dynamic collision system. The positives are bountiful.  Another is the marvellous job PES Productions has done crafting the individual  physical traits of key players, many of which are now imbued with new layers of  realism in how they move and interact. Tevez can bullishly dash into the box  whilst hustling defenders in pursuit, Lewandowski can steamroll centrebacks,  and Robben can perform his signature jink down the right, cutting inside, and  placing the ball in the far post.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">How these are animated is exceptional. You'd still  know you were watching Robben even if he was wearing a wig. How he runs,  twists, and curls his left leg when shooting is all faithfully recreated.  Konami claims that PES 2016 amasses three times the volume of animations than  its predecessor; a bold statement that invites cynicism, but a believable one  nevertheless.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's a shame, then, that the graphical fidelity  does not quite match the standards set by the animations. Much of PES 2016 was  built with the Fox Engine, and aside from how intriguing it is to see how  Balotelli would look in&nbsp;Metal Gear Solid 5, sometimes the character models  resemble animated cadavers when cast in unflattering light. They also can't  smile properly, which results in unintentionally hilarious contract signing  cut-scenes.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">That's probably a little harsh on a game that has  clearly improved its visuals from last year. The lighting is less washed out,  the pitch and clothing textures are sharper, and the weather effects are fine.  These improvements don't extend to the UI and menu system, however, which still  carries a couple of nagging foibles, such as untidy text alignment on the  formation and tactics pages.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="605" height="332" src="game-content-img/vga_pes16_clip_image006_0000.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1544/15443861/2936910-ob_385b2e_pes-2016-image-screenshot-6-0903d40000.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Teams under pressure will park the bus, which in  turn can trap them in their own half. Only cool heads will prevail.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Such trivialities wash away at kick-off, when  the&nbsp;<em>feel&nbsp;</em>engulfs you. Matches are brought to life thanks to  the AI, which sets a new benchmark for the genre. It's almost as if you and the  computer have known each other for years; AI teammates move off the ball  realistically, and signal where they want the pass, and run into the exact  pocket of space that you hoped they would.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">In each game you encounter dozens of these smart  individual AI decisions, but just as impressive is how players work together as  a unit. A deeper understanding of the sport runs throughout each team, which  works hard to retain formation whilst adapting to opportunities and dangers.  Fullbacks overlap, midfielders drop back, defenders close gaps, keepers dash  out of the box, but in all cases, only when it makes sense. It inspires more  calculated build-up play, where it's the better team that emerges victorious,  as opposed to the one that had the most superstar moments.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Like with all recent editions of PES, a wealth of  gameplay options await, with updates to modes such as Become A Legend, Master  League, and MyClub (the latter was inaccessible during review due to the  servers being down). Master League has been given a brilliant&nbsp;Football  Manager-aping redesign, with a calendar view and news items all displayed on  its home screen.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Yet there's little worth in assessing soccer sims  by the weight of their game modes, or indeed, the breadth of their official  licences. All that truly matters is what unfolds in those virtual ninety  minutes, either against a friend, an online stranger, or the computer. On that  test alone, PES 2016 represents the best game in the series since the  PlayStation 2 era.</p>
