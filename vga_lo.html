    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You&rsquo;d  think that being alone and adrift in outer space, with neither a ship nor a way  to communicate with civilization, would be a slow affair (and almost certainly  lead to a depressing death). You might expect to gradually float through the  void, pondering your life choices as you starve to death. According to Lost  Orbit, however, you can make it home in one piece as long as you hurtle past  asteroids, orbit some planets, avoid some lasers, and make a robot friend along  the way.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">You  are Harrison, a maintenance worker sent out alone to repair a com relay far  from civilization. While making the repairs, your ship blows up, leaving you  with nothing but a spacesuit that evidently has an infinite supply of thruster  fuel. At first glance, Lost Orbit resembles an old-school arcade shoot-em-up.  You can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen as the action  automatically scrolls forward. The biggest difference, though, is that there is  no shooting here, only dodging. You want a high score at the end of a level?  Then you're going to have to dodge stuff while moving really fast.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img width="548" height="307" src="game-content-img/vga_lo_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/1552/15524586/2862187-0007.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Space into dreams.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  breakneck speeds you can reach in Lost Orbit evoke some of the same excitement  you might get from a fast, arcade-style racing game. Boosting and zig-zagging  your way through clumps of asteroids and other obstacles isn't too different  from weaving through traffic in a game like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/burnout-3-takedown/"><span style="text-underline:none; color:windowtext; text-decoration:none; ">Burnout</span></a>, and it brings with it the same risk: If you  collide with a hard surface, the result is going to be messy. Moving rapidly  through tight, dangerous spaces is exhilarating, but a slight twitch in the  wrong direction could mean instant death.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It's  not just chunks of rock you have to worry about. As you make your way home, you  encounter old machinery, lasers, aliens, and more potentially deadly perils.  Then there are the objects that aren't necessarily deadly but still affect your  flight path, like wormholes that teleport you across the screen, pulsars that  push you away, gas giants that give you a boost of speed, planets you can orbit  around, and more. Oh, and did you think you'd only be&nbsp;<em>dodging</em>&nbsp;everything?  You also must collect bright purple pieces of &quot;obtainium,&quot; which  contribute to your score and allow you to buy permanent upgrades.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_lo_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1552/15524586/2862185-0001.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Way to orbit.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">So  there's a lot going on, but thankfully, moving around feels natural, though it  may not be what you expect at first. Your character is flying through space in  an Iron Man-like fashion. When you tilt the analog stick left or right, you  actually tilt his body left or right in the same way you might bank an airplane  (albeit a very agile one). Tilt hard enough, and you actually begin to loop  around, allowing you to do a quick 180 if you know you don't have room to dodge  an obstacle. It doesn't take long to get a handle on how to move exactly the  way you want, giving you great precision even at high speeds.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">One  clever method for getting out of harm's way is to wrap around the screen. If  you venture off the right side of the screen, you re-appear on the left and  vice versa. If wrapping doesn't provide a large enough safety net, you can  spend the obtanium you collect on a few new abilities, including a faster boost  (one that's more limited in its usage, making it more like nitrous in a racing  game); a barrel roll you can use to move left and right more quickly; and the  ability to slow down, which is a vital skill to have while zooming through  space. You can also buy the game's lone offensive ability: a bomb that blows up  certain obstacles in your immediate vicinity.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">When  everything comes together and your reflexes are sharp, the speed and precision  of Lost Orbit's 2D gameplay would make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous. Boosting  through a cluster of asteroids, narrowly dodging turret fire, orbiting around  one planet to refill your boost meter then dashing through another to get an  extra burst of speed...there's a lot of timing to get down, but when you nail  it, everything feels fluid. The sense of accomplishment you get when you make  it through a level while barely slowing down is addicting.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><img border="0" width="480" height="270" src="game-content-img/vga_lo_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Description: http://static2.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/1552/15524586/2862183-0006.jpg"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Spend obtanium to obtain abilities!</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">It  also looks great in motion, making good use of subtle but effective character  animations combined with flashy colors and visual effects. Even dying has its  own special touch. There are plenty of death animations (usually of the  over-the-top comedic violence variety) to marvel at, provided you don't hit the  reset button as quickly as possible every time you make a mistake.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The  story has a striking element of charm to it. Harrison's adventure is narrated  by a similarly lonesome robot with some humorously tragic (and sometimes  touching) things to say. The downside is that while this commentary is  interesting the first time through, it's not as appealing when you replay  levels multiple times either to improve on your last performance or simply  because you keep dying. Hearing the same lines of dialogue repeated over and  over grows tiresome quickly, and there doesn't seem to be any way to turn the  narration off.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><em>When everything comes  together and your reflexes are sharp, the speed and precision of Lost Orbit's  2D gameplay would make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous.</em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Levels  in Lost Orbit are short and usually beatable in a couple of minutes at most.  Checkpoints scattered throughout them make completing the game a short,  relatively easy task. The game's roughly 40 stages can be completed within two  or three hours if you're not worried about how you're ranked at the end of each  one. If you do want to be rewarded with a platinum medal for each level (or a  high spot on the time trial leaderboards), though, you'll want to get through  each one as quickly as possible without dying while collecting every piece of  obtanium along the way. This is a fun challenge, though there's a bit of frustration  involved every time you want to try a stage again. While there's a button  dedicated to restarting a stage quickly, the reset isn't instant, forcing you  to wait a few seconds every time you want to go back to the beginning of a  stage. That might not sound too bad, but if you keep messing up halfway through  a level, it's frustrating to not be able to go back instantly. Games with  similar time-based leaderboards, like&nbsp;Super Meat Boy, have spoiled us with  their instant restart abilities.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Due in  part to its brevity, Lost Orbit isn't the most memorable of adventures. You  barrel through its levels quickly, and unless you want to try for faster time  trial scores, there's not a lot to come back for. Still, the rush of speed and  the simple charms of the animation and narration make this game a blast while  it lasts.</p>
