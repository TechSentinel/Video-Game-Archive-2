    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Much has changed  since we reviewed&nbsp;Diablo III&nbsp;at its launch in May of 2012, both in  the game itself and in the PC gaming landscape. Now, those looking for great  multiplayer hack-and-slash dungeon crawls have more options, like the colorful  and appealing&nbsp;Torchlight II&nbsp;and the deep, grim,  free-to-play&nbsp;Path of Exile. With these great games on the market that  scratch the same itch, Diablo III is less essential. However, thanks largely to  significant changes made in a recent patch in advance of the upcoming Reaper of  Souls expansion, Diablo III is a better game now than it's ever been, and is a  worthy contender for your time if you're looking to kill legions of monsters  and score some sweet loot.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">The recent changes  to Diablo III are dramatic and immediately noticeable. After patch 2.0.1 was  released on February 25, I took my level 44 witch doctor out for a spin for the  first time in ages, and after playing for about an hour, I'd already collected  rare and legendary weapons and armor that far outstripped anything I'd been  using before. Gear is better now not only in terms of its base stats, but also  in terms of its other characteristics. Whereas before, I tended to stick with  the same few skills throughout the game, now, gear encourages me to switch  things up periodically by offering hefty percentage bonuses to the damage done  by a specific skill.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">Some  characteristics aren't about increasing an item's power but about doing other  nifty things; a colleague of mine was able to equip a powerful level 60 weapon  at level 47 because one of its attributes reduced its level requirement by 13.  You find cool, useful stuff a lot more frequently now, which makes the whole  process of collecting loot more exciting and rewarding, and the smart ways in  which this loot sometimes encourages you to change up your build make for a  more varied game. And with the controversial auction house now offline and with  restrictions on trading legendary gear, you have to earn the best stuff  yourself, which is the way it always should have been.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; ">After  advancing a few levels on the normal difficulty and never breaking a sweat, I  upped things to hard to take advantage of the 75 percent bonus to experience  and gold that comes with the increased challenge. This made for a more  involving experience; on normal I could mindlessly slaughter most foes, but on  hard I had to focus on what I was doing and use my skills in concert with each  other to overcome some of the tougher encounters, marking enemies for death,  setting up my sentry turret, and vaulting out of the way of enemy attacks. The  difficulty system has been tweaked significantly since the game's release, with  monsters now scaling to your character's level. As you get better at the game  and improve your character's equipment, you're incentivized to up the  difficulty to reap greater rewards in terms of gold, experience, and gear, and  for the satisfaction of overcoming greater and greater challenges. I'm now  facing the still-tougher enemies of the expert level.</span></p>
    <p style="text-align:center;"><img width="480" height="268" src="game-content-img/vga_diablo3_clip_image001.jpg" alt="Description: http://static5.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_medium/78/787590/2456662-ci-138732582430360093.jpg"><span style="font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">After once again vanquishing Diablo and starting  over from act one, I hit the current level cap of 60 (which Reaper of Souls  will increase to 70) and started earning paragon experience. Though the paragon  system was introduced way back in patch 1.0.4, this was my first experience with  it. I'm not usually much of an endgame player; once I've completed the story in  a game, there's not much appeal for me in continuing to play purely for the  sake of earning better loot or increasing my character's power. But I can see  the appeal in earning paragon levels. With each level you earn, you get a point  to spend on one of four tiers: improving your core attributes, your offensive  or defensive abilities, or matters of utility, like resource costs and the  amount of gold you find. Though you can earn paragon experience with a  character only once that character has hit level 60, the paragon points you  earn are given to each of your characters. Previously, Diablo III offered  little in the way of opportunities to continue improving your character after a  certain point, but now paragon levels, along with the prospect of better and  better loot on harder difficulties, give you concrete benefits for continued  play.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">Fundamentally, Diablo III is still the same  experience it's always been. You click on monsters and press a few keys on your  keyboard to unleash attacks to kill tons of monsters to collect heaps of gold  and loot to become more effective at killing tons of monsters, and while the  loot system has gotten a major overhaul, skills and runes work like they always  have. The offensive skills of each class look powerful and feel empowering,  movement is fluid, and the action is fast and responsive. Though its core  mechanics are commonplace, Diablo III creates a sense of drama that helps it  stand out. In the third act setting of Bastion's Keep, massive demons claw  their way onto the battlements, and as towering statues crumble around you in  the high heavens, the turmoil supports the aim of the halfhearted narrative to  make you feel like an eternal conflict between the angels and the legions of  hell is culminating and that you're right in the middle of it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">And of course, Diablo III is still at its best when  you join forces with other players, combining close-quarters abilities and  ranged attacks, crowd control abilities, and area-of-effect damage.  Unfortunately, Diablo III still requires you to be online at all times, even if  you're content to play by your lonesome, and this sometimes causes problems.  I've run into severe latency issues on a few occasions when playing the game  recently, and though my character hasn't perished, combat in these instances  has been completely unmanageable.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; "><img width="611" height="325" src="game-content-img/vga_diablo3_clip_image003.jpg" alt="Description: http://static1.gamespot.com/uploads/scale_super/78/787590/2456663-ci-187130852830360092.jpg"></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size:12.0pt; ">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;line-height:normal;">A lot the Discordant hates it a lot when you kill  him.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;line-height:normal;">But this has been a rare occurrence throughout the  20 hours or so that I've spent playing the game since picking it back up after  the recent patch, and because loot is such a central part of the Diablo  experience, the significant improvements to Diablo III's loot system have  resulted in a significantly better game. If you played Diablo III when it was  first released and haven't been back to it in a while, you'll immediately be  pleased to find that the loot you're collecting is consistently better and  consistently more suited to your chosen class. If you haven't played Diablo III  before but you're thinking of diving in before the expansion is released,  you're in luck: taking on the minions of hell has never been more rewarding.</p>
